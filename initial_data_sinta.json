Digital media commonly used today is digital media that is generally owned by Indonesian netizens, namely social media. By only having internet access all netizens can become social media users. Using internet access is not only used by Indonesian people in person, but Indonesian people to interact in an industry \/ company often interact with the use of internet media, considering that the development of the Digital Industry Revolution has entered the Industrial Revolution 4.0. \"Both practitioners and academics agree that the social revolution occurring through digital channels will have a profound impact on hoe people interact with each other and how companies manage their relationships in the changing communications landscape (Greenberg, 2010;Kletzmann et al.,2011;Dennis et al.,2009)\" (Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, Vol. 30). The government is committed to increasing Indonesia's competitiveness position from 41st to 39th in the world from 138 countries listed in the 2016-2017 Global Competitiveness Report. To achieve this goal, one of the solutions being pushed by the Ministry of Industry is to spur domestic industries to continue to innovate in the face of the implementation of Industry 4.0. Because of that case, human interaction in the industry will not be separated from a communication process, it's just that at this time different is a tool \/ media in carrying out the communication process, which originally used conventional communication media to switch to convergence (digital) communication media. Currently PT. Telkom Indonesia Tbk as a subject of this research, conducts monitoring and analysis of public opinion one of them by using Social Media Monitoring. Based on the results of pre-research by interview some informants, they said that PT. Telkom Indonesia Tbk conducts Social Media Monitoring with the aim to find out how much positive \/ negative sentiment to Telkom's Social Media brand as a whole building to Corporate Image and also for the others needed such as building Product Image and Product Marketing. PT. Telkom Indonesia Tbk analyzes public opinion with the use of social media because there is an element of transfer of communication patterns from conventional media to digital media, but apart from that, PT. Telkom Indonesia Tbk continues to analyze conventional public opinion, including via e-mail, the voice of the reader, also through the call center 147 service and also through the application \"apps my indihome\". In addition, PT Telkom Indonesia often analyzes public opinion with the support of various other events, namely the \"Public Hearing\" and also \"Focus Group Discussion\" carried out by each division of the platform holder where in this research is the Corporate Communication Division, Customer Division Care and also the Marketing Promo Division. The research method used in this study is a case study where there is a pecualiarity in this study, namely PT Telkom Indonesia Tbk is an industry that is very concerned about public opinion on its customers so that handling feedback becomes a very important and main thing by doing social media monitoring with help by the agency or carred out by related unit employees. \u00a9 2019, Library Philosophy and Practice.","abstrakClean":"development information communication technology today make community individually society realm industry carry communication activity using medium often referred digital medium digital medium commonly used today digital medium generally owned indonesian netizens namely social medium internet access netizens become social medium user using internet access used indonesian people person indonesian people interact industry company often interact use internet medium considering development digital industry revolution entered industrial revolution practitioner academic agree social revolution occurring digital channel profound impact hoe people interact company manage relationship changing communication landscape greenberg kletzmann et aldennis et al journal business industrial marketing vol government committed increasing indonesia competitiveness position st th world country listed global competitiveness report achieve goal one solution pushed ministry industry spur domestic industry continue innovate face implementation industry case human interaction industry separated communication process time different tool medium carrying communication process originally used conventional communication medium switch convergence digital communication medium currently pt telkom indonesia tbk subject research conduct monitoring analysis public opinion one using social medium monitoring based result preresearch interview informant said pt telkom indonesia tbk conduct social medium monitoring aim find much positive negative sentiment telkoms social medium brand whole building corporate image also others needed building product image product marketing pt telkom indonesia tbk analyzes public opinion use social medium element transfer communication pattern conventional medium digital medium apart pt telkom indonesia tbk continues analyze conventional public opinion including via email voice reader also call center service also application apps indihome addition pt telkom indonesia often analyzes public opinion support various event namely public hearing also focus group discussion carried division platform holder research corporate communication division customer division care also marketing promo division research method used study case study pecualiarity study namely pt telkom indonesia tbk industry concerned public opinion customer handling feedback becomes important main thing social medium monitoring help agency carred related unit employee library philosophy practice","aspects":["SDG1","SDG9","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Lecturer and literacy in higher education","Penulis":"Rita Prima Bendriyanti, Citra Dewi, Rina Julita, ","Tahun":2019,"Abstrak":"Literacy movement currently becomes a movement socialized in every society.

The rational of this study was based on the fact that the majority of research within the service failure and service recovery fields has been in the context of off line service encounter rather than on line platform. In fact, in the era of e-commerce, customers increasingly involve information and technology in their product and service consumptions. Indeed, from searching information, deciding, purchasing, consuming, spreading information about their experience using on line media. As such, business firms need to understand the on line behavior of their customers and how to response. Using a qualitative approach toward 81 online complaints about hotel services in Indonesia, it was found that not many hotels engaged in the on line conversation. Such efforts were made dominantly by higher star rated hotels. The most frequent type of reaction was apology. Some hotels include explanation with regard to the case, however merely apologized. Only a few hotels offered discounted room rate or voucher for next visit. Interestingly, the amount of discount seems to be adequate as customers perceived a discount of less than 10% to be considered not meaningful.

Semedi is a new show cave, but information about arthropods in this cave was not available. The use of cave as a tourist attraction will bring environmental changes which potentially disturb cave-dwelling arthropod community. This study aimed to measure arthropod diversity and their relation to abiotic factors in Semedi Show Cave. Arthropods were sampled by hand collecting, a combination of pitfall and bait traps, and Berlese extractor. Abiotic factors measured were climatic and edaphic parameters. Sampling was conducted in the 3 zones of Semedi cave (Entrance, Twilight, and Dark). Data were analyzed by calculation of richness (Margalef), diversity and evenness (Shannon-Wiener) indices, cluster and correlation analyses. A total 1095 individuals of arthropods consisting of 102 morphospecies, belonging to 6 Classes, and 19 Orders were sampled during this study. The entrance zone had higher richness and diversity indices (richness=12.80, diversity=3.40) than the twilight zone (richness=7.85, diversity=3.25) and the dark zone (richness=5.35, diversity=2.63). Meanwhile, the twilight zone had higher evenness index (0.85) than the entrance zone (0.77) and the dark zone (0.77). Each zone of Semedi cave had different abiotic conditions. Abiotic conditions and Arthropod communities in the twilight and dark zones were more similar to each other than to those of the entrance zone. The statistical analyses showed that there were significant correlations between abiotic factors and arthropod communities. Semedi had various cave-dwelling arthropods.

Unfortunately, this diversity has not been explored to create artistic pattern, especially batik. Although there are lots of nature based batik patterns, most of these patterns are developed based on land plant. In the other hand, Indonesia as an archipelago country has lots of ocean biota and one of them is coral. In this research, we propose simplified computational coral model. The simplification is needed because modeling real coral growth or morphology is very complicated and resource consuming. This model then is implemented to create batik pattern computationally. This model is developed based on the stochastic approach. In this research, we propose three coral models based on the genus: Leptoseris, Gardinesoris, and Acropora. These basic coral models then have been implemented to generate batik pattern by adding artistic objects. Based on several tests, changing some controlled variables can generate different shapes or variation. In some range, the generated image still can be recognized as coral. In other range, the result image cannot be recognized as coral anymore. By ignoring complicated the environmental and biological aspects, the proposed model still can generate coral pattern and then is implemented to generate batik pattern. \u00a9 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","abstrakClean":"coral one ocean organism beauty various unfortunately diversity explored create artistic pattern especially batik although lot nature based batik pattern pattern developed based land plant hand indonesia archipelago country lot ocean biota one coral research propose simplified computational coral model simplification needed modeling real coral growth morphology complicated resource consuming model implemented create batik pattern computationally model developed based stochastic approach research propose three coral model based genus leptoseris gardinesoris acropora basic coral model implemented generate batik pattern adding artistic object based several test changing controlled variable generate different shape variation range generated image still recognized coral range result image recognized coral anymore ignoring complicated environmental biological aspect proposed model still generate coral pattern implemented generate batik pattern ongoing jatit lls","aspects":["SDG1","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Design of land optical fiber backbone communication network in North Sumatera","Penulis":"Yudiansyah, Prita Dewi Mariyam, Arie Pangesti Aji, Novietasari Chisnariandini, Catur Apriono, ","Tahun":2018,"Abstrak":"The demand for high-speed data transmission has increased significantly in recent years.

Utilizing vehicle-based sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, IMA offers extended vision to provide early warning for an imminent crash. However, most of IMA-related research implements their methods and strategies only in simulations, test tracks, or driving simulator studies that have quite a few assumptions and limitations and hence the effectiveness evaluations reported may not be transferable or comparable. Methods: This study seeks to develop a generalized evaluation scheme that can be used not only to assess the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety at intersections but to facilitate comparisons across similar studies. The proposed evaluation scheme utilizes the concepts of traffic conflict in terms of time-to-collision (TTC) as a crash surrogate. This approach avoids the issue of having insufficient crash frequency data for system evaluation. To measure the effectiveness of IMA on reducing traffic conflicts, a relative risk is calculated for comparing the risk of with\/without using the IMA. As a proof-of-concept study, this study applied the proposed evaluation scheme and reported the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety in a field operation test (FOT). Seven test scenarios were conducted at 4 intersections, and a total of 40 participants were recruited to use the IMA for 6\u00a0months. Results: It was estimated that IMA users have 26% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 5\u00a0s and have 15% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 4\u00a0s. However, the results vary across different sites and different definitions of conflicts in terms of TTC.

The experimental results were compared with Palm-Oil biodiesel with blending ratio of 5vol%, 10vol% and 15vol%. Nevertheless, the result indicated that the ignition delay is slowed when ambient temperature is increased. These phenomena can be explained by the thermal properties of fuels.

(eds.), Coastal Ecosystem Responses to Human and Climatic Changes throughout Asia. The sea is essential to life on earth, including regulating the climate, producing oxygen, providing medicines, providing habitats for marine animals, and feeding millions of people. It must be ensured that the sea continues to meet the needs of life without sacrificing the people of future generations. The sea regulates the planet's climate and is a significant source of nutrients. The sea becomes an essential part of global commerce, while the contents of the ocean become the solution of human energy needs today and the future. The wealth and potential of the sea as a source of energy for humans today and the future needs to be mapped and described to provide a picture of marine potential to all concerned. As part of the government, the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries is responsible for the process of formulating, determining, and implementing policies in the field of marine and fisheries based on the results of mapping and extracting information from existing conditions. The results of this information can be used to predict the marine potential in a marine area. This prediction process can be developed using data-mining techniques such as applying the association rule by looking at the relationship between the quantity of fish based on the plankton abundance index. However, this association rules data-mining techniques that require complete data, which are data sets with no missing values to generate interesting rules for detection systems. The problem is often that required marine data are not available or that marine data are available, but they contain incomplete data. To address this problem, this paper introduces a Relative Tolerance Relation of Rough Set (RTRS). Novelty RTRS differs from previous rough approaches that use tolerance relationships, nonsymmetric equation relationships, and limited tolerance relationships. The RTRS approach is based on a limited tolerance relationship considering the relative precision between two objects; therefore, this is the first job to use relative precision. In addition, this paper presents the mathematical approach of the RTRS and compares it with other existing approaches using the marine real dataset to classify the marine potential level of the region. The results show that the proposed approach is better than the existing approach in terms of accuracy. \u00a9 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2018.","abstrakClean":"saedudin rr kasim mahdin h sutoyo e riyadi yanto hassan r ismail relative tolerance relation rough set rtrs potential fish yield indonesia ashraf chowdhury ajk ed coastal ecosystem response human climatic change throughout asia sea essential life earth including regulating climate producing oxygen providing medicine providing habitat marine animal feeding million people must ensured sea continues meet need life without sacrificing people future generation sea regulates planet climate significant source nutrient sea becomes essential part global commerce content ocean become solution human energy need today future wealth potential sea source energy human today future need mapped described provide picture marine potential concerned part government ministry marine affair fishery responsible process formulating determining implementing policy field marine fishery based result mapping extracting information existing condition result information used predict marine potential marine area prediction process developed using datamining technique applying association rule looking relationship quantity fish based plankton abundance index however association rule datamining technique require complete data data set missing value generate interesting rule detection system problem often required marine data available marine data available contain incomplete data address problem paper introduces relative tolerance relation rough set rtrs novelty rtrs differs previous rough approach use tolerance relationship nonsymmetric equation relationship limited tolerance relationship rtrs approach based limited tolerance relationship considering relative precision two object therefore first job use relative precision addition paper present mathematical approach rtrs compare existing approach using marine real dataset classify marine potential level region result show proposed approach better existing approach term accuracy coastal education research foundation inc","aspects":["SDG1","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Predicting Jakarta composite index using hybrid of fuzzy time series and support vector regression models","Penulis":"Rian Febrian Umbara, Dede Tarwidi, Erwin Budi Setiawan, ","Tahun":2018,"Abstrak":"The paper discusses the prediction of Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) in Indonesia Stock Exchange.

This has resulted in imports of 100,000 tons of cacao in 2014. Such an issue happens due to many factors, for instance fluctuation of cacao prices, low farmer income and land conversion. The cause of land conversion is that cacao crops are no longer attractive to farmers, thus many of them are turning to other commodities. The objective of this research is to analyze the basic needs of farmers in order to determine the optimal quantities that farmers should supply. The methodology adopted for the research is Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) to determine the basic needs of farmers in the cacao supply activities. Based on the results, there are 5 basic needs of the farmers in supporting the activities of cacao Supply Chain, which are counselling, fair profit distribution, price guarantee from government, industry coordination and development of transparent information system. Among the main results, the development of fair profit distribution and price guarantee from governments are at the lowermost hierarchical level. Micmac diagrams show that it is laid in the independent sector (sector-IV). Thus, they become key elements of the cacao supply and need to be necessarily implemented.

In the context of lifelong learning, the learner model is a user learning pattern, which can be modelled all the time based on user interaction with various sources. The main issue in lifelong learner model design is what type of information needs to be stored in the learner model and how the information granularity is involved. The type and level of information granularity of a user will determine how appropriate the pedagogical policies are to be provided by the system for a user. Lifelong learner model design should be in line with the principles of lifelong learning, namely sociality, interoperability, and scrutability. This paper discusses our research on learner model ontology for lifelong learning. The goal expected to be achieved is that there is a lifelong learner model ontology to be accessed and updated by adaptive learning systems. This research classifies learners' attributes into two groups, which are static and dynamic attributes. Static attributes tend not to change or very rarely change. They include learner's profile, special needs, aptitude, preference, learning approach, learning style, personality, and cognitive capability. On the other hand, dynamic attributes include learning history and study plan. Through conducting some experiments, it can be concluded that LifeOn supports ubiquitous and lifelong learning, and can be used in adaptive learning systems with various learner models. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","abstrakClean":"one challenge adaptive learning system manage learner model include learner profile activity interaction learner learning tool context lifelong learning learner model user learning pattern modelled time based user interaction various source main issue lifelong learner model design type information need stored learner model information granularity involved type level information granularity user determine appropriate pedagogical policy provided system user lifelong learner model design line principle lifelong learning namely sociality interoperability scrutability paper discus research learner model ontology lifelong learning goal expected achieved lifelong learner model ontology accessed updated adaptive learning system research classifies learner attribute two group static dynamic attribute static attribute tend change rarely change include learner profile special need aptitude preference learning approach learning style personality cognitive capability hand dynamic attribute include learning history study plan conducting experiment concluded lifeon support ubiquitous lifelong learning used adaptive learning system various learner model ieee","aspects":["SDG4"]},{"Judul":"Reasoning about traffic signals controller for intersection with contraflow lanes for bus rapid transit using linear-time temporal logic","Penulis":"Muhammad Arzaki, Yanti Rusmawati, Anggita Karlinda Kusnadi, Sarah Andianti Atmawardhana, ","Tahun":2018,"Abstrak":"Computational and formal modeling have been used in traffic engineering, mainly to optimize the management of traffic signals and avoid collisions at intersections.

However, LMS has some drawbacks particularly in presenting and selecting learning materials or resources. On LMS, students are given only learning materials or learning resources that have been structured by the facilitator. On the other side, the idea of Personal Learning Environment (PLE) arises. PLE represents a different perspective on how students decide where are they going to learn, because they act as subjects and owners of their own learning process, not as objects. PLE enables students to collaborate through service or learning resources outside their predefined online classroom page. This research proposes the idea to embed the concept of PLE into LMS.

Besides, the length of the distribution of red pepper (farmer- the middleman- wholesaler- retailer- consumer) results in significant price changes from farmers to consumers at each echelon or distribution level. Such price changes result in a decline in the farmer's share.

In order to understand public opinion, the legacy method such as interview, questionnaire, and other time-consuming method is still widely used in this sector. However, this method is less efficient compared to data analytics methodology using available data from online source, such as social media Therefore, we need to conduct a research to see a better method in order to understand the public opinion in hospitality sector. There are many methodologies to support content analysis based on unstructured data to understand public opinion. In this research, we use content analysis methodology which consists of Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling, and Text Network Analysis to process 483413 obtained tweets from January 7thuntil March 28th, 2017. The twitter data is gained using Python and R language. The whole process of the research consists of data collection, data preprocessing, and interpreting the results. We use Rstudio, Jupyter Notebook and Gephi softwares during the process. As a case study in the hospitality sector, we use Airbnb as one of the sharing economy business models that allows other people to share their space and begins to be widely used by travelers around the world. Our objective is to understand public opinion towards Airbnb as online-based sharing economy business model which becomes a disruptive innovation for tourism industry. As the result, we are able to apply the combination of content analysis methods to give a good understanding towards the public opinion.

The content store size is limited so special techniques are required to optimize content store usage and keep NDN performance in good level. In the previous study, the majority choose data to be stored in content stores based on content popularity only. Popular data will be prioritized to keep in content store and the data with less popularity will be deleted from content store when it is full. This basic technique is known as 'sharing-technique'.

Therefore, based on these problems, the hotspots forecasting model research will be conducted to prevent the expansion of forest and land fires. Forecasting time series uses historical data to predict future data. The time series forecasting model used in this study applies the Box-Jenkins procedure to build ARIMA models that are compatible with the data and applies the ARIMA models obtained to make predictions of the occurrence of hotspots in July-December 2019. Based on the research results, the best model is obtained. ARIMA (2,0,2) with non-zero mean with AICc value of 408.62. Model evaluation is used to determine the accuracy of the ARIMA model (2,0,2) in forecasting by looking at the error value.

Even though the incumbent firms have strong reputation, they need to develop new distinct capabilities to create value in the long run. The fastest way to develop new capabilities is through collaboration also known as co-creation. Co-creation is a form of economic strategy to bring mutual values from different parties as a mediating role in creating business model innovations. Since there are limited study on co-creation strategy in relation to corporate reputation and business model innovation, this paper aims to assess the mediating role of co-creation strategy on the relationship between business model innovation and corporate reputation.

In general, it is developed using a probabilistic-based data-driven approach and directly applied to a sequence of graphemes with no other information. Important research shows that incorporating information of syllabification point is capable of improving a probabilistic-based English G2P. However, the information should be accurately provided by a perfect orthographic syllabification. Some noises or errors of syllabification significantly reduce the G2P performance. In this paper, incorporation of syllabification points into a probabilistic-based G2P model for Bahasa Indonesia is investigated. This information is important since Bahasa Indonesia is richer than English in terms of syllables. A 5-fold cross-validating on 50 k words shows that the incorporation of syllabification points significantly improves the performance of G2P model, where the phoneme error rate (PER) can be relatively reduced by 10.75%. This PER is much lower than the G2P model based on an inductive learning algorithm. An important contribution of this research is that the proposed G2P model is quite robust to syllabification errors. A syllable error rate (SER) of 2.5% that comes from an orthographic syllabification model just slightly increases the PER of the proposed G2P model from 0.83% to be 0.90%.

Design\/methodology\/approach: The first section discusses the theoretical framework along with the sustainability challenges faced by companies in Indonesia. The second section develops the methodology of the study to measure the SRI by considering practical and theoretical perspectives, starting from the identification of initial disclosure, selecting the final disclosure and developing the hierarchical framework. Lastly, the third section confirms the validity of the study\u2019s framework by the exploratory factor analysis method and its comparability by comparing the content analysis result of the study with the Kinder\u2013Lydenberg\u2013Domini (KLD) method. The content analysis was used to analyze annual reports, sustainability reports and companies\u2019 websites based on indicators found in the resulted model. Findings: The main finding is the SRI framework (SRIF) of the study, which is built on the basis of the stakeholder relationship theory and is focused on three main dimensions (social, economic and environmental). Specifically, the framework consists of 17 indicators and 93 sub-indicators. On the basis of factor analysis method, it can be safely said that the study\u2019s SRIF is quite valid. The high score of correlations between the SRIF and KLD results at the composite and dimension levels, along with the statistically significant results show that the study\u2019s SRIF results and KLD results are fairly similar. Research limitations\/implications: The present study has its limitation as it only gathers data from publicly available reports issued by the firms (secondary data). Owing to time limitation, primary data are not collected. However, this is also the strength of this research as it will allow investors to replicate the study\u2019s methodology to measure companies\u2019 sustainability. Practical implications: The study is useful to organizations and statutory bodies toward finding a replicable method to measure the Indonesian companies\u2019 social performance. In addition, the study also introduced the usefulness of the qualitative program Atlas TI to perform content analysis, the exploratory factor analysis method to ensure validity and comparability by comparing it to the KLD methodology, which is known globally as the most widely accepted methodology to measures social performance. Lastly, this study will provide implications to the Government to ascertain the level of SRI reporting among the Indonesian public-listed companies.

The work done in the production process at manufacturing, such as the rubber processing industry, produces waste that harms the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor business activities. In this study focuses on designing application based on Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) by running a green procurement system therein. Green procurement provides solutions to the selection of materials and services that can minimize the impact on the environment and provide benefits for the company. In implementing of green procurement system, ISO 14000 standardization data to determine the green supplier and the green material attributes data are needed to use for the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) report. The ERP-based application can generate report Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for green materials and green suppliers to help the company to monitor business processes in green procurement. However, the process of measuring the percentage of green materials and green suppliers is out of the scope of the discussion in this study, because this study only provides designing an application to implement green procurement. The selection of application based on Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) is due to an ERP system that can add and also update data and information without duplication so that it can improve employee efficiency in monitoring business process activities with data integration in application based on Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP). The design of this application is tailored to the user requirements for green procurement that focus on the ability of the application system to provide purchase requisition, request for quotation, supplier selection, purchase order and integrating data such as payment of materials with the finance division, integrating data material that enters warehouse with the warehouse division.

The ideal cholesterol level in the human body is <200. High cholesterol can increase the risk of getting serious diseases such as strokes and heart attacks. Checking cholesterol levels through checking blood sugar requires the patient to undergo fasting for 10-12 hours first and processing the results of the examination also requires not a short time. Because of the seriousness of the disease that can be caused, an early examination is needed and it is also practical to determine the level of excess cholesterol in the human body. Iris has specific advantages which can record all organ conditions, body construction and psychological conditions. Therefore, Iridology as a science based on the arrangement of the iris can be an alternative for medical analysis. In this study, the author designed a system in the matrix simulator which is expected to be able to detect excess cholesterol levels with input in the form of iris images and then through the pre-processing stage then extracted features with the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix method and classified using the Linear Regression method. The result from the modeling process can inform about cholesterol level. These processes make early detection of human body cholesterol level becomes easier. The cholesterol data level is classified into: normal cholesterol, at risk of cholesterol and high cholesterol. Each class was represented by 30 images, and each of it divided into two data types, 20 images used as training data and the remaining as testing data.

Wireless mobile broadband technology uses limited resources, namely the frequency spectrum. It is an interesting problem because the frequency spectrum regulates by government, so the allocation is restricted. Not requiring a longer time, the licensed frequency for mobile broadband is becoming increasingly full and facing a problem, namely spectrum scarcity. 3GPP saw this opportunity by launching LTE-Advanced Pro (4.9 G) technology through 3GPP Release-13, namely Licensed Assisted Access (LAA). LAA uses carrier aggregation technology between the licensed band and unlicensed band of 5 GHz. The 5 GHz frequency allocation is for ISM needs. LAA aims to increase network capacity, increase efficiency, and increase downlink speed. Several countries in the world already deploy LAA. However, many countries are still doing a trial of LAA technology, including Indonesia. Indonesia represents one of the largest countries in the world, and the number of a mobile broadband user is one of the largest with the rapid growth of mobile user. Thus LAA deployment in Indonesia is required to face spectrum scarcity. This work is intended to examine the technology and the regulation and market readiness of LAA implementation, especially in Indonesia. In this paper, we do study briefly about LAA implementation in several countries based on their frequency regulation requirement, market, and how the technical challenge goes on.

So, for customer who sends more than one package to more than one destination, the cost is still calculated in regular price without any reduction. The other problem is even there is more than one shipment, customer has to create order one by one and the packages will be delivered by different driver. So, developing combined shipping system will benefit the customer and the driver. In this research, we propose combined shipping model for city courier service by comparing two methods: least effort and random walk algorithm. In this study, we compare the performance of combined shipping that uses least effort or random walk method and conventional one to one shipping model. In this research, we found that combined shipping that implements least effort algorithm produces the best performance both in non financial aspect and financial aspect. By using least effort algorithm, system generates lowest total driver travel distance and highest average driver's travel distance.

The purpose of e-tendering is to facilitate the procurement process with related parties to increase productivity, effectiveness, and transparency in the tender process. However, problems in the e-tendering system are currently centralized, so that the local LPSE organization has full control of the database and the system which can pose a threat of vulnerability to fraud, collusion, and manipulation practices. The tender selection process that is full of competition must be supported by effective and transparent technology so that it does not cause fraud and suspicion among bidders. Blockchain technology is one of the solutions that allow integrated systems without a third party because it adheres to the decentralized nature of distributed databases so that it has a copy of many users. By adopting blockchain e-tendering can reduce the source of fraud, namely database manipulation. This research will explore the process of developing a blockchain-based system with e-tendering case studies on LPSE. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","abstrakClean":"tender process long complex business process produce series legal obligation related business contract purpose conducting tender government support work program finding right tender provider good service government procurement program basis decision choose suitable tender government indonesia tender process carried using etendering system use internet technology lpse purpose etendering facilitate procurement process related party increase productivity effectiveness transparency tender process however problem etendering system currently centralized local lpse organization full control database system pose threat vulnerability fraud collusion manipulation practice tender selection process full competition must supported effective transparent technology cause fraud suspicion among bidder blockchain technology one solution allow integrated system without third party adheres decentralized nature distributed database copy many user adopting blockchain etendering reduce source fraud namely database manipulation research explore process developing blockchainbased system etendering case study lpse ieee","aspects":["SDG1","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"RFID Characteristics Test as Business Needs at Logistic Companies in Indonesia","Penulis":"Muhamad Irsan, Dina Fitria Murad, Erick Fernando, Derist Touriano, Andrea Corradini, ","Tahun":2019,"Abstrak":"In embedded RFID chips for storing records or data, such as Electronic Product Code one of them using barcode, in tag.

Renewable energy power plants can replace these diesel-based power plants. Thus, energy optimization is critical for the improvement of the energy efficiency of the renewable energy system. The optimization of a photovoltaic energy system through a hybrid energy storage system is analyzed for the off-grid island. The hybrid energy storage system involves the hybridization of two energy storage systems including a battery storage system and a hydrogen storage system. The management of a photovoltaic hybrid energy storage system requires a power management system. This paper proposes a power management system based on the peak shaving strategy in hydrogen energy storage to improve the efficiency of the hybrid energy storage system while considering the surplus energy forecasting. The hybrid energy storage system typically focuses on the efficiency of a closed system. In such a closed system, the optimization focuses on the life-saving of the battery. The energy storage peak shaving is used to improve the efficiency of the hybrid energy storage system, for the maximization of excess hydrogen to supply electricity to the islands. The result reveals that the average efficiency of the hybrid energy storage system based on the proposed power management system is 52.3%, which is 29.6% higher than the one obtained from traditional power management system strategy, whereas the battery depreciation is improved by 1.2%. \u00a9 2019 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.","abstrakClean":"electrical supply rural area especially small island commonly utilizes ecounfriendly costly dieselbased power plant renewable energy power plant replace dieselbased power plant thus energy optimization critical improvement energy efficiency renewable energy system optimization photovoltaic energy system hybrid energy storage system analyzed offgrid island hybrid energy storage system involves hybridization two energy storage system including battery storage system hydrogen storage system management photovoltaic hybrid energy storage system requires power management system paper proposes power management system based peak shaving strategy hydrogen energy storage improve efficiency hybrid energy storage system considering surplus energy forecasting hybrid energy storage system typically focus efficiency closed system closed system optimization focus lifesaving battery energy storage peak shaving used improve efficiency hybrid energy storage system maximization excess hydrogen supply electricity island result reveals average efficiency hybrid energy storage system based proposed power management system higher one obtained traditional power management system strategy whereas battery depreciation improved praise worthy prize srlall right reserved","aspects":["SDG7"]},{"Judul":"Smart Cane: Public Transportation Code Detection and Identification System for Visually Impaired","Penulis":"Kevin Manuel Suhandi, Gita Indah Hapsari, Giva Andriana Mutiara, ","Tahun":2019,"Abstrak":"The visually impaired people are still having difficulties to be able to take advantage of public transportation in their daily activities.

Methods: This secondary research collected data from macroeconomic and AI-specific data sets. The sources of data from which insights were gained included digital technology sectors and corporations and their functions. The focus was on the need to assess the capability of AI on business operations The macroeconomic data was collected from data resources of international organizations\u2019 including the World Economic Forum, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, this study has considered 19 economic indicators to analyze the economic outcome of AI in selected economies of Asia-Pacific. Results: From the results, the period between 2014 and 2016 witnessed China leading with over 25,000 citable documents on the AI topic. Regarding institutions that were observed to publish over 500 times on the AI topic, the countries in the ascending order include China (600), Hong Kong (1,100), and Singapore (2,000). As such, this study established that Asia-Pacific economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore though have smaller populations, but the majority of their higher education institutions have made a significant contribution to AI research; with the small economies also having a relatively higher number of computer scientists among the top 1,000 individuals. Additionally, through empirically analyses, during 1998\u20132016 with annual observations, it is found that various economic outcomes of AI were presented in 8 economies of targeted region. Limitations: At first, the future outlook of AI is just discussed in conceptual meaning while empirical context still needs to be examined in upcoming studies. At second, covering the overall South Asian region provides better findings with more generalization which is missing in current research. At third, other dimensions of AI and economy like implication of AI impact index and its relationship with macroeconomic variables is also missing in current research which could be reconsidered in coming studies. Conclusion: It is evident that AI exhibits the potential to be the main driver of Asia-Pacific\u2019s economic growth. Relative to the net and gross effect of AI on labor markets and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the top Asia-Pacific economies demonstrate that by 2030, AI might yield a 16-percent increase in output, translating into an estimated amount of $13 trillion. Overall, it is concluded that Asia-Pacific, when compared to developed regions such as North America, is lagging but the availability of a large pool of user data implies that the region can move ahead\u2014given better resource and talent allocation. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

There is a rapid transformation in PV regulation by the government. Four regulation related to solar PV is delivered from 2016 until 2018. In 2018, the feed-in tariff regulation was established. The feed-in tariff aims the electricity customer to install the PV system and inject the excess energy to the grid. However, this rapid regulation changing is not yet attracting developer nor customer to invest in the solar PV. This paper proposes a simple model to calculate the optimal size of PV for new feed-in tariff regulation in Indonesia. Feed-in tariff regulation allows the customer to inject the energy produced by PV to the grid. The regulation provides 65% compensation of electricity price from energy sent to the grid with several limitations. There is difficulty to estimate daily energy data. Then, a technical calculation is proposed by using a simple model so that it can help the customer in sizing the solar PV system. Adding to the proposal of the methodology, this research also develops an application to help customers in calculating the optimal size of solar PV and its profitability. The new feed-in tariff rule will be an attraction for the customer. However, it needs a comprehensive calculation so that solar PV can be profitable. Oversized PV systems can cause financial losses with the large investment and limitation on the calculation of energy injected into the grid. The result shows that the PV simple model is successfully developed to help the consumer obtain the optimal PV size. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","abstrakClean":"indonesia still struggling attract investor involve solar photovoltaic pv project rapid transformation pv regulation government four regulation related solar pv delivered feedin tariff regulation established feedin tariff aim electricity customer install pv system inject excess energy grid however rapid regulation changing yet attracting developer customer invest solar pv paper proposes simple model calculate optimal size pv new feedin tariff regulation indonesia feedin tariff regulation allows customer inject energy produced pv grid regulation provides compensation electricity price energy sent grid several limitation difficulty estimate daily energy data technical calculation proposed using simple model help customer sizing solar pv system adding proposal methodology research also develops application help customer calculating optimal size solar pv profitability new feedin tariff rule attraction customer however need comprehensive calculation solar pv profitable oversized pv system cause financial loss large investment limitation calculation energy injected grid result show pv simple model successfully developed help consumer obtain optimal pv size ieee","aspects":["SDG1","SDG7","SDG13","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Classification of gene expressions of lung cancer and colon tumor using Adaptive-Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) as the feature selection","Penulis":"Zainuddin S., Nhita F., Wisesty U.N., ","Tahun":2019,"Abstrak":"Cancer is one of the death causes in most countries.

Given the reliance of a large segment of the population on the agricultural sector for both their livelihoods as well as national food security, climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector is crucial for continued national food security and economic growth. Using household data from lowland rice farmers of selected haor areas in Sylhet, the current work presents an analysis of the determinants behind the implementation of different climate change adaptation strategies by lowland rice farmers. The first objective of this study was to explore the extent of awareness of climate change within this population as well as the type of opinions held by lowland rice farmers with respect to climate change. To serve this purpose, a severity index (SI) was developed and subsequently employed to evaluate the perceptions and attitudes of 378 farmers with respect to climate change vulnerability. Respondents were interviewed with respect to climate change related circumstances they faced in their daily lives. Attained SI index values ranged from 69.18% to 93.52%. The SI for the perception \"Climate change affects rice production\" was measured as 93.52%. Using data collected from the same 378 farmers, a logistic regression was carried out to investigate the impact of socio-economic and institutional factors on adaptation. The results show that credit from non-government organizations is highly statistically significant for adaptation, and that rural market structure also has a positive effect on adaptation. Among the studied factors, credit from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) was found to be the most important factor for adaptation. The results of this work further indicate that marginal farmers would benefit from government (GoB) funded seasonal training activities that cover pertinent information regarding adaptation after flash floods. Additionally, the authors of this piece recommend timely issuance of government-assisted credit during early flash floods to afflicted farmers, as such an initiative can aid farmers in adapting different strategies to mitigate losses and enhance their productivity as well as livelihood. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","abstrakClean":"bangladesh remains one vulnerable country world effect climate change given reliance large segment population agricultural sector livelihood well national food security climate change adaptation agricultural sector crucial continued national food security economic growth using household data lowland rice farmer selected haor area sylhet current work present analysis determinant behind implementation different climate change adaptation strategy lowland rice farmer first objective study explore extent awareness climate change within population well type opinion held lowland rice farmer respect climate change serve purpose severity index si developed subsequently employed evaluate perception attitude farmer respect climate change vulnerability respondent interviewed respect climate change related circumstance faced daily life attained si index value ranged si perception climate change affect rice production measured using data collected farmer logistic regression carried investigate impact socioeconomic institutional factor adaptation result show credit nongovernment organization highly statistically significant adaptation rural market structure also positive effect adaptation among studied factor credit nongovernmental organization ngo found important factor adaptation result work indicate marginal farmer would benefit government gob funded seasonal training activity cover pertinent information regarding adaptation flash flood additionally author piece recommend timely issuance governmentassisted credit early flash flood afflicted farmer initiative aid farmer adapting different strategy mitigate loss enhance productivity well livelihood author","aspects":["SDG1","SDG2","SDG8","SDG11","SDG13","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Performance of Outdoor Lamp Implementation for Visible Light Communication under Ambient Environment","Penulis":"Ronaldo Soritua Sitanggang, Denny Darlis, Karina Wahyu Noviyanti, ","Tahun":2019,"Abstrak":"Visible Light Communication is an optical wireless communication technology that convey information by modulating visible light over some standard illumination.

This infection is characterized by the appearance of rashes all over the body and potentially cause serious complications, especially among infants and children. Before measles immunization was promoted, it is one of the endemic diseases that caused the most fatalities each year in the world. This paper aims to analyze and to investigate measles transmission in Jakarta via an SIHR epidemic model involving vaccination from January to December 2017. Jakarta Health Office collected the observed data of measles incidence. We then derived the basic reproduction number as a threshold of disease transmission and obtained the local as well as global stability of the equilibria under certain conditions. The unobserved parameters and initial conditions were estimated by minimizing errors between data and numerical results. Furthermore, a stochastic model was developed to capture the data and to accommodate the randomness of the transmission. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to analyze and to identify the parameters which give significant contributions to the spread of the virus. We then obtained simulations of vaccine level coverage. The data is shown within a 95% confidence interval of the stochastic solutions, and the average of the stochastic solutions is relatively close to the solution of the deterministic model. The most sensitive parameter in the infected compartment is the hospitalized rate, which can be considered to be one of the essential factors to reduce the number of cases for policymakers. We hence proposed a control strategy which is providing treatment accesses easier for infected individuals is better than vaccinating when an outbreak occurs. \u00a9 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

When the power transformer could not work properly or out of service in unforeseen ways, it provides a severe impact on power system utilities and customers in term of the expensive of transformer's replacement cost and revenue lost caused by the electrical blackout. To overcome these issues, the proper prognostics health management (PHM) system as a tool for condition monitoring and health assessment of these valuable assets is required. This paper proposed a PHM system based on a kernel extreme learning machine (K-ELM) for power transformer's health assessment. Two sets of variable combinations called Set-1 and Set-2 were considered to examine the robustness and efficacy of the proposed method. In Set-1, the input variables were water content, total acidity, breakdown voltage, dissipation factor, dissolved combustible gases, and 2-furfuraldehyde. While the output of PHM system was the health condition which categorized as good, moderate, and bad circumstances. Set-2 utilized water content, total acidity, breakdown voltage, dissipation factor, and interfacial tension as input variables. Whereas, the PHM system outputs consisted of four categories: normal, good, moderate, and bad.

Recently, the combination of several drugs has been used to treat this disease. However, the parasite is known to be resistant to the anti-malarial agent. Hence, a new candidate for an anti-malarial drug is required to solve the resistance problem. One compound that is promising as an anti-malarial agent is fusidic acid derivatives. Fusidic acid is an antibiotic that is work by preventing parasite growth. Besides, fusidic acid is known to have antiplasmodial activity although the IC50 is still poor. However, the activity can be improved by optimizing the structure through its derivatives. In this study, we developed a QSAR model to predict the activity of fusidic acid derivatives as anti-malarial agent. The model was developed by using Simulated Annealing (SA) for feature selection and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for model development. The results show that SA produces a satisfying combination of features that are indicated by the trend of MSE value during the selection process. Regarding the performance, SVM with RBF kernel produces the best result of the validation parameter.

Ground truth myocardial landmarks were defined and tracked by manual initialization and correction of deformable image registration using previously validated software with five readers. The fully automatic framework consisted of (a) a convolutional neural network (CNN) for localization and (b) a combination of a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a CNN to detect and track the myocardial landmarks through the image sequence for each slice. Radial and circumferential strain were then calculated from the motion of the landmarks and averaged on a slice basis. Results: Within the test set, myocardial end-systolic circumferential Green strain errors were 20.001 \u00b1 0.025, 20.001 \u00b1 0.021, and 0.004 \u00b1 0.035 in the basal, mid-, and apical slices, respectively (mean \u00b1 standard deviation of differences between predicted and manual strain).

However, they are limited in fully elucidating the significance of the ordered-mutation because they did not focus on the network dynamics. Therefore, there is a pressing need to investigate the dynamics characteristics induced by ordered-mutations. Methods: To quantify the ordered-mutation-inducing dynamics, we defined the mutation-sensitivity and the order-specificity that represent if the network is sensitive against a double knockout mutation and if mutation-sensitivity is specific to the mutation order, respectively, using a Boolean network model. Results: Through intensive investigations, we found that a signaling network is more sensitive when a double-mutation occurs in the direction order inducing a longer path and a smaller number of paths than in the reverse order. In addition, feedback loops involving a gene pair decreased both the mutation-sensitivity and the order-specificity. Next, we investigated relationships of functionally important genes with ordered-mutation-inducing dynamics. The network is more sensitive to mutations subject to drug-targets, whereas it is less specific to the mutation order. Both the sensitivity and specificity are increased when different-drug-targeted genes are mutated. Further, we found that tumor suppressors can efficiently suppress the amplification of oncogenes when the former are mutated earlier than the latter. Conclusion: Taken together, our results help to understand the importance of the order of mutations with respect to the dynamical effects in complex biological systems. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).","abstrakClean":"background many previous clinical study found accumulated sequential mutation statistically related tumorigenesis however limited fully elucidating significance orderedmutation focus network dynamic therefore pressing need investigate dynamic characteristic induced orderedmutations method quantify orderedmutationinducing dynamic defined mutationsensitivity orderspecificity represent network sensitive double knockout mutation mutationsensitivity specific mutation order respectively using boolean network model result intensive investigation found signaling network sensitive doublemutation occurs direction order inducing longer path smaller number path reverse order addition feedback loop involving gene pair decreased mutationsensitivity orderspecificity next investigated relationship functionally important gene orderedmutationinducing dynamic network sensitive mutation subject drugtargets whereas le specific mutation order sensitivity specificity increased differentdrugtargeted gene mutated found tumor suppressor efficiently suppress amplification oncogene former mutated earlier latter conclusion taken together result help understand importance order mutation respect dynamical effect complex biological system author","aspects":["SDG3"]},{"Judul":"Rural entrepreneurship: Towards collaborative participative models for economic sustainability","Penulis":"Wawan Dhewanto, Sudrajati Ratnaningtyas, Anggraeni Permatasari, Grisna Anggadwita, Eko Agus Prasetio, ","Tahun":2020,"Abstrak":"Rural entrepreneurship development is one of the strategies for encouraging the acceleration of rural development by focusing on the exploration of local resources.

The conversion of DC power into AC power will cause power losses so that it will reduce the generator efficiency. One solution related to this problem is to develop DC House, i.e. a residential with DC power loads in it.

One of the most costly and time-consuming applicant selection stages is the interview process, since it usually performs face to face meetings and involves third parties to do the interviews and analyze the result. To this end, Human Capital Directorate at Telkom Indonesia adopts AI technology to automate some stages of job applicant selection to reduce manual process and third-party involvement. In this paper, we investigate appropriate feature extraction methods to automate job interview grading for reducing bias and human errors. TFIDF, one of the most popular feature extractions, is compared with word embedding to find the optimal method and parameters in classifying interview verbatims with ANN classifier. Based on the test results, the average accuracy for TFIDF outperforms word embedding by 85.22% against 74.88%, respectively.

NGN is one of the current telecommunication infrastructure network technology trends. It provides a simpler concept with only two layers of service and transport. The NGN IP-based transport system can connect with various types of networks, which leads to low management costs by offering different kinds of services. Meanwhile, there are currently various types of telecommunication networks depending on the services provided, such as Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), IPv4 Internet as well as Public Switched Data Network (PSDN). PSTN is a circuit-switched voice communications network, and PSDN is a network for data-based communications with International Telecommunication Union (ITU)-T X.121 standards. Another type is a packet-switched based network that uses IPv4 addressing systems. Each network has its customers. One of the problems that arise, however, is how to transform the current network system to the NGN network effectively. The effectiveness of network transformation in the service provision for users is determined by the technical aspects used. Some of the technical aspects issues on implementation of NGN networks in Indonesia are the use of a protocol for signaling, coding standards, Quality of Service (QoS), numbering and addressing, and security. This paper proposes technical specifications for the effectiveness of NGN network implementation in Indonesia.

The level of digital mastery of the organization was determined using quantitative techniques through a self-assessment questionnaire.

Furthermore, a re-annotation to the existing Cityscapes dataset enriches the ground-truth labels by annotating the attributes of pedestrian orientation. We implement the proposed method and compare the experimental results with others. The attribute-aware semantic segmentation shows the ability to outperform baseline methods both in the traditional object segmentation task and the expanded attribute detection task.

The government issued the first regulation on solar PV, announced in 2016. A revision on the local tariff regulation is conducted to reduce the rapid development of the solar PV investment. The major revision is made to change the contract scheme from a build-operate-own (BOO) to a build-operate-own-transfer (BOOT) scheme. This paper investigates how the new local tariff will drive investors and developers to invest in solar PV. This analysis is conducted to know the effectiveness of the policy and the risk of PV investment in Indonesia. Local tariff policy regulation targets PV developers to invest in the solar PV system areas. In the local tariff policy, each area has its PV energy tariff determined by the government. This research proposes a method for deciding demand by considering population data in selected regions to calculate the maximum PV demand of each area. The Levelized Cost of Energy LCOE is used to calculate the economic viability of the PV projects in selected areas in Indonesia. The results show that more than half of the selected areas are profitable for the PV project. The average profit of the projects of the selected areas is 3.21 cent USD per kWh. Most of the areas that have high PV demand have lower local tariffs. Therefore, these areas may not be profitable for developers. The new regulation also cuts the revenue significantly due to the new scheme contract. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","abstrakClean":"indonesia still struggling attract investor developing solar photovoltaic pv project government issued first regulation solar pv announced revision local tariff regulation conducted reduce rapid development solar pv investment major revision made change contract scheme buildoperateown boo buildoperateowntransfer boot scheme paper investigates new local tariff drive investor developer invest solar pv analysis conducted know effectiveness policy risk pv investment indonesia local tariff policy regulation target pv developer invest solar pv system area local tariff policy area pv energy tariff determined government research proposes method deciding demand considering population data selected region calculate maximum pv demand area levelized cost energy lcoe used calculate economic viability pv project selected area indonesia result show half selected area profitable pv project average profit project selected area cent usd per kwh area high pv demand lower local tariff therefore area may profitable developer new regulation also cut revenue significantly due new scheme contract published licence iop publishing ltd","aspects":["SDG1","SDG7","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Culturable gut bacteria of ikan batak (Neolissochilus sumatranus weber & de beaufort, 1916) collected in toba samosir, indonesia","Penulis":"Achmad Dinoto, Rini Handayani, Ninu Setianingrum, Heddy Julistiono, ","Tahun":2020,"Abstrak":"Ikan Batak (Neolissochilus sumatranus Weber & de Beaufort, 1916) is one of the fish species that is rarely found in water and have the status of endangered species.

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) is one of the most known approaches for predicting diabetes. Many researchers have found by combining KNN with one or more other algorithms may provide a better result. In this paper, a combination of three procedures, removing noise, reducing the dimension, and weighting distance, is proposed to improve a standard voting-based KNN to classify Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) into two classes. First, the noises in the training set are removed using k-means clustering (KMC) to make the voter data in both classes more competent. Second, its dimensional is then reduced to decrease the intra-class data distances but increase the inter-class ones. Two methods of dimensional reduction: principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoder (AE), are applied to investigate the linearity of the dataset. Since there is an imbalance on the dataset, a proportional weight is incorporated into the distance formula to get the fairness of the voting. A 5-fold cross validation-based evaluation shows that each proposed procedure works very well in enhancing the KNN. KMC is capable of increasing the accuracy of KNN from 81.6% to 86.7%. Combining KMC and PCA improves the KNN accuracy to be 90.9%. Next, a combination of KMC and AE enhances the KNN to gives an accuracy of 97.8%. Combining three proposed procedures of KMC, PCA, and Weighted KNN (WKNN) increases the accuracy to be 94.5%. Finally, the combination of KMC, AE, and WKNN reaches the highest accuracy of 98.3%.

Mihardjo, Towhid Parikhani, ","Tahun":2020,"Abstrak":"Direct-expansion solar-assisted heat pump water heaters (DX-SAHPWHs) are conducive to the environment due to the use of ambient energy and solar radiation. This paper aims to design and develop a thermodynamic model and a multi-criteria optimization of thermal performance for a DX-SAHPWH using R-134a as the working refrigerant that supplies domestic hot water for a typical building throughout the whole year. The thermodynamic model of the DX-SAHPWH is developed so that the performance of the system is solved through the try and error technique with the least initial data of the thermodynamic cycle of DX-SAHPWH. After the validation of the thermodynamic model, the performance of the DX-SAHPWH is analyzed for a typical building located at the temperate climate of Iran. Then, a parametric study is conducted to identify how various design parameters may affect the performance of the DX-SAHPWH system. In the current investigation, the effects of design parameters including solar radiation intensity, ambient air temperature, outlet water temperature of the condenser, solar collector area, compressor speed, length of tube in the condenser, external diameter of the tube in collector plate, fin thickness, and thermal conductivity of collector plate on the performance of the DX-SAHPWH are investigated. Besides, single and bi-criteria optimizations are carried out using genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the optimal solutions of design parameters, where the coefficient of performance (COP) and the solar collector efficiency (SCE) are selected as two fitness functions. The optimal solutions achieved from the bi-criteria optimization process will be given as Pareto frontier. The final optimum solution from the available solutions on the Pareto optimal frontier is selected using decision-making methods, such as LINMAP, TOPSIS, and Shannon's Entropy. The comparison of single and bi-criteria optimization results illustrate that the bi-criteria optimization method yields more proper results than single ones, mainly because of the lower deviation index from the ideal solution. The results of bi-criteria optimization show that SCE decreases 1.6% compared to the initial model while the COP increases close to 20% that makes the optimum solution more desirable compared to the single ones. Moreover, the performance of the optimized DX-SAHPWH system is compared with the initial model in each month of the year. The results indicate that the performance of the optimized DX-SAHPWH is highly improved so that the working hours of the system decrease close to 109 h compared to the initial model during the whole year. \u00a9 2020","abstrakClean":"directexpansion solarassisted heat pump water heater dxsahpwhs conducive environment due use ambient energy solar radiation paper aim design develop thermodynamic model multicriteria optimization thermal performance dxsahpwh using ra working refrigerant supply domestic hot water typical building throughout whole year thermodynamic model dxsahpwh developed performance system solved try error technique least initial data thermodynamic cycle dxsahpwh validation thermodynamic model performance dxsahpwh analyzed typical building located temperate climate iran parametric study conducted identify various design parameter may affect performance dxsahpwh system current investigation effect design parameter including solar radiation intensity ambient air temperature outlet water temperature condenser solar collector area compressor speed length tube condenser external diameter tube collector plate fin thickness thermal conductivity collector plate performance dxsahpwh investigated besides single bicriteria optimization carried using genetic algorithm ga obtain optimal solution design parameter coefficient performance cop solar collector efficiency sce selected two fitness function optimal solution achieved bicriteria optimization process given pareto frontier final optimum solution available solution pareto optimal frontier selected using decisionmaking method linmap topsis shannon entropy comparison single bicriteria optimization result illustrate bicriteria optimization method yield proper result single one mainly lower deviation index ideal solution result bicriteria optimization show sce decrease compared initial model cop increase close make optimum solution desirable compared single one moreover performance optimized dxsahpwh system compared initial model month year result indicate performance optimized dxsahpwh highly improved working hour system decrease close h compared initial model whole year","aspects":["SDG1","SDG7","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Reporting system design for family planning field officers in DPPKB using business process improvement (BPI)","Penulis":"Fakhirah Nur Alifah, Christanto Triwibisono, Litasari Widyastuti Suwarsono, ","Tahun":2020,"Abstrak":"Family Planning (FP) field officers are the people actively working in the field to encourage people to get involved in the family planning program that supports the government in controlling the population of the country.

Based on data from the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Indonesia, the distribution of Riau's hotspots is quite unique. It is said so, because in this distribution, Riau has increased in every February and March as many as 277 and 248 hotspots in the last two years, namely between 2018 and 2019. To anticipate the drought that occurred in Riau, the clustering of drought-prone areas was conducted based on the analysis of hotspots data. This clustering of vulnerable areas is done by the K-Means algorithm. In determining the number of clusters of vulnerable areas, the elbow method is used as a determinant and produces as many as 4 cluster. The results of these method were analyzed by the silhouette coefficient. The result of analyzed is 0.388632163 and were classified as well-clustered. From these results, Rokan Hilir, Bengkalis, Kota Dumai are the dangerous district with 3106, 2361, and 117 point of dangerous distribution, respectively. \u00a9 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","abstrakClean":"drought disaster often experienced indonesia disaster occurred indonesia geographical location equator drought major impact community crop failure forest fire soil damage emergence disease outbreak extinction animal plant based data ministry environment republic indonesia distribution riaus hotspot quite unique said distribution riau increased every february march many hotspot last two year namely anticipate drought occurred riau clustering droughtprone area conducted based analysis hotspot data clustering vulnerable area done kmeans algorithm determining number cluster vulnerable area elbow method used determinant produce many cluster result method analyzed silhouette coefficient result analyzed classified wellclustered result rokan hilir bengkalis kota dumai dangerous district point dangerous distribution respectively association computing machinery","aspects":["SDG1","SDG11","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"In-vitro molecular docking analysis of microalgae extracted phycocyanin as an anti-diabetic candidate","Penulis":"Heli Siti Halimatul Munawaroh, Gun Gun Gumilar, Fina Nurjanah, Galuh Yuliani, Siti Aisyah, Dewi Kurnia, Asri Peni Wulandari, Isman Kurniawan, Andriati Ningrum, Apurav Krishna Koyande, Pau-Loke Show, ","Tahun":2020,"Abstrak":"Phycocyanin (PC) is the main pigment found in Spirulina platensis and has the potential effect to treat effectively type-2 diabetes mellitus by inhibiting \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase.

In this study, an in-silico study was carried out to predict the molecular interactions between PC with \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase enzymes. Molecular docking simulations indicated that PC inhibits the enzymes by binding to the active site and causing a disruption on substrate-enzyme binding.

Both Muslim and non-Muslim customers have subscribed to the products. Thus, it is critical to analyse the strategy of IBs\u2019 moral messages in reminding their Muslim and non-Muslim customers to repay their credit card debts. This paper aims to investigate this issue in Indonesia using data mining via machine learning. Design\/methodology\/approach: This study examines the IBs\u2019 customers across the 32 provinces of Indonesia regarding their moral status in credit card debt repayment. This work considers 6,979 observations of the variables that affect the moral status of the IBs\u2019 customers in repaying their debt. The five types of data mining via machine learning (i.e. Boruta, logistic regression, Bayesian regression, random forest, XGBoost and spatial cluster) are used. Boruta, random forest and XGBoost are used to select the important features to investigate the moral aspects. Bayesian regression is used to get the odds and opportunity for the transition of each variable and spatially formed based on the information from the logistical intercepts. The best method is selected based on the highest accuracy value to deliver the information on the relationship between moral status categories in the selected 32 provinces in Indonesia. Findings: A different variable on moral status in each province is found. The XGBoost finds an accuracy value of 93.42%, which the three provincial groups have the same information based on the importance of the variables. The strategy of IBs\u2019 moral messages by sending the verse of al-Qur\u2019an and al-Hadith (traditions or sayings of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH) and simple messages reminders do not impact the customers\u2019 repaying their debts. Both Muslim and non-Muslim groups are primarily found in the non-moral group. Research limitations\/implications: This study does not consider socio-economic demographics and culture. This limitation calls future works to consider such factors when conducting a similar topic.

In addition, future works may advance the recent findings by considering socio-cultural factors to investigate the moral status approach to Islamic credit warnings that is not covered by this study. Social implications: This work finds that religious text of credit card repayment reminders sent to Muslims in several provinces of Indonesia does not affect their decision to repay their debts. To some extent, this finding draws a social issue that the local IBs need to consider when implementing the strategy of credit card repayment reminders.

This disease is considered as a deadly disease. In 2019, 1700 deaths occur every day due to cancer. Some effective anti-cancer agents are known to cause temporary to chronic toxic effects. There are several compounds that have the potential to become anticancer drugs, one of them is indenopyrazole. Recently, not many QSAR studies have been conducted to exploit the potential of indenopyrazole as anti-cancer agent. The goal of this research is to implement simulated annealing and support vector machine method in the QSAR study to predict the activity of indenopyrazole derivatives as anti-cancer drugs. Simulated annealing is used for feature selection and support vector machine is used for model development. In this research, we used three kernel models for SVM, namely SVM with RBF kernel, SVM with linear kernel, and SVM with the polynomial kernel. From three models that were regressed, SVM with RBF kernel has parameter C=10, gamma=scale and epsilon=0.1 produce R2 score train and test 0.79 and 0.60, respectively.

In Indonesia, zone-based model is adopted in the public-school admission system. Students are assigned to their nearest school. Besides location, student\u2019s academic performance and economic level are also concerned. Based on it, this work proposes coordinated public school admission model that accommodates flexible number of the concerned parameters. It is built based on the stable marriage algorithm or the deferred-acceptance algorithm as its derivative. The proposed model is a combination between the mandatory approach and the school choice approach. The concerned parameters are school-home distance, student national exam score, school rank, applicant poor status, and applicant\u2019s preference. The simulation is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed model compared with the previous models: the zone-based model and the two-step model. The prioritization of the concerned parameters is proven easily adjusted. The simulation result shows that in the over-demand condition, the proposed model creates higher average student national exam score and higher average school-home distance rather than the previous models. When the number of applicants is twice of the number of seats, the proposed model creates 6.6 percent higher in the average student national exam score and 71.4 percent higher in the average school-home distance.

CO2 is one of the greenhouse gasses emitted by human activities or by natural produces, CO2 molecules can absorb infrared radiation and trap some energy from it in the atmosphere which can trigger global warming, therefore it is important to be observed. To achieve the mission, an InGaAs Photodiode sensor will be used in this payload. This sensor will measure the power of infrared radiance in the atmosphere, and the final output from this payload module is an analog signal in voltage magnitude. By measuring this parameter which is the power of infrared radiance in the atmosphere, it is expected for the payload to be able to estimate the CO2 concentrations. This paper will also show the performance of the integrated amplifier circuit to amplify the produced signal from the InGaAs Photodiode sensor since this sensor will produce an analog signal in a very small magnitude. \u00a9 2021 Author(s).","abstrakClean":"cubesat type miniaturized satellite least xx cm cubic unit volume le kg per unit mass based cubesat standard currently cubesat technology mostly used earth observation purpose paper co detection payload cubesat proposed expected able detect co concentration km altitude co one greenhouse gas emitted human activity natural produce co molecule absorb infrared radiation trap energy atmosphere trigger global warming therefore important observed achieve mission ingaas photodiode sensor used payload sensor measure power infrared radiance atmosphere final output payload module analog signal voltage magnitude measuring parameter power infrared radiance atmosphere expected payload able estimate co concentration paper also show performance integrated amplifier circuit amplify produced signal ingaas photodiode sensor since sensor produce analog signal small magnitude author","aspects":["SDG1","SDG13"]},{"Judul":"5G Fixed Wireless Access Network for Urban Residential Market: A Case of Indonesia","Penulis":"Muhammad Kevin Adityo, Muhammad Imam Nashiruddin, Muhammad Adam Nugraha, ","Tahun":2021,"Abstrak":"The quick advancement of technology has increased commercial rivalry in telecommunications, compelling broad-band network operators to be more effective in assembling Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditures (OPEX) requirements to avoid the scissor effect.

A ventilator is a device that serves to assist or replace normal ventilation functions in people who have respiratory problems. The lungs are important organs in the respiratory system. The lungs can inflate if the atmospheric pressure is greater than the lung pressure (Palv). Conversely, the lungs can deflate if the atmospheric pressure is less than Palv. In the process of inspiration, air flows from outside to the alveoli, increasing oxygen levels. The faster oxygen is introduced into the alveoli from the atmosphere, the higher the oxygen concentration in the alveoli. So that the oxygen concentration in the alveoli is controlled by the speed with which new oxygen enters the lungs through the ventilation process. In people who have respiratory problems, the body is less able to supply the oxygen needs of the lungs so that the flow of air pressure that flows into the lungs must be controlled. A ventilator is made with the principle of pressure difference. Atmospheric pressure is set greater than Palv so that air enters the lungs. In contrast, atmospheric pressure is set to be less than Palv to force air out of the lungs. The outside air pressure can be increased by providing positive pressure air from the airflow drive device. With the Fuzzy Logic control method, the speed of the airflow drive device is adjusted to meet the patient's needs. Ventilators that have been designed and manufactured can provide air pressure in the pressure range of 0 to +50 cmH2O or the equivalent of 0 to 0.711167 psi. The basic pressure at the end of the breath is set to be equal to atmospheric pressure.  \u00a9 2021 IEEE.","abstrakClean":"virus outbreak attack human respiration increase need ventilator proportional availability ventilator device serf assist replace normal ventilation function people respiratory problem lung important organ respiratory system lung inflate atmospheric pressure greater lung pressure palv conversely lung deflate atmospheric pressure le palv process inspiration air flow outside alveolus increasing oxygen level faster oxygen introduced alveolus atmosphere higher oxygen concentration alveolus oxygen concentration alveolus controlled speed new oxygen enters lung ventilation process people respiratory problem body le able supply oxygen need lung flow air pressure flow lung must controlled ventilator made principle pressure difference atmospheric pressure set greater palv air enters lung contrast atmospheric pressure set le palv force air lung outside air pressure increased providing positive pressure air airflow drive device fuzzy logic control method speed airflow drive device adjusted meet patient need ventilator designed manufactured provide air pressure pressure range cmho equivalent psi basic pressure end breath set equal atmospheric pressure ieee","aspects":["SDG3"]},{"Judul":"Techno-economic analysis of stand-alone PV system: A case study of public street lighting for remote area in Indonesia","Penulis":"Ajiwiguna T.A., Qurthobi A., ","Tahun":2021,"Abstrak":"Stand-alone Photovoltaic (PV) system is mostly required for the remote areas where the electricity is limited or not available from the grid.

The paper maps and characterizes the conditions of open innovation against cleaner production in Indonesian batik small and medium enterprise (SME), particularly in Java and Madura. The mapping process is executed by classifying the batik SME into four quadrants. The diagram is a quadrant in which there are four parts to distinguish each of the ability of batik SMEs in understanding and achieving cleaner production through open innovation. This research will obtain a new method or model that can be applied by organizations to achieve cleaner production through an open innovation. The data is obtained from 182 batik SMEs located in Laweyan, Madura and Lasem (in Java Island, Indonesia). Design\/methodology\/approach: One of the problems in batik SME is the waste management from the dyeing and wax removal process. In the first stages of this research, a number of initial models were elaborated as a reference, then the results of the elaboration became a new research model. The research model that has been produced is then tested using data from respondents. Based on the test results, the model can be stated valid or not. In this study, the model is valid after testing data from 182 respondents, because all outer loading for all indicators is above 0.7. The composite reliability and AVE values of all constructs were above 0.7 and 0.5. Based on the validated research model, the data is statistically processed by using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). By using the SEM method and statistical software SMART PLS 3.0this research can be supported to achieve the research objectives. Findings: Based on data testing and processing, open innovation climate could predict a sustained relationship to open innovation with an accuracy rate of 0.466 and influence rate of 0.427, whereas open innovation could predict a sustained relationship to cleaner production with an accuracy rate of 0.183 and influence rate of 0.324. The relationships between open innovation climate and open innovation; including open innovation toward cleaner production, are statistically significant because all prediction values and accuracy in the model have met the criteria for measurement parameters based on the value of R2, p value and T-statistics to be stated as a significant relationship. Research limitations\/implications: This research provides an overview of the influence and importance of open innovation in creating an environmentally friendly production process in the context of cleaner production. Cleaner production on batik SMEs can be achieved through open innovation, both for inbound open innovation and outbound open innovation. Open innovation comprehensively provides support for batik SMEs in achieving cleaner production. Open innovation can be run well and optimally if it gets support from a conducive climate open innovation. Furthermore, the implementation of cleaner production could be a guideline for the owner to minimize the waste from batik SME production, both for natural and synthetic dyes. Some limitations in these study include the absence of influence from the existing stakeholders on batik SMEs on the implementation process of open innovation; the use of the cross-sectional approach that results in the unavailability of further analysis regarding the dynamics or improvements that occur in attaining cleaner production through open innovation; and finally providing no analysis of the differences in characteristics at each location of batik SMEs.

Recent studies have underpinned project resilience as a major factor for overcoming these increasing project failures, delays, or ter-mination. However, the complex behaviors of resilient project leaders, especially in post-failure conditions, have been largely overlooked. To address this critical research gap, the present study identifies the direct relationships between three potential behavioral traits of project leaders (i.e., resilience, self-esteem, and self-efficacy) and examines how they move forward beyond project failures. The present study also explored whether self-esteem mediates project leaders\u2019 resilience and self-efficacy. Drawing on data from 232 project leaders in Pakistan\u2019s high-tech start-ups, the new findings suggest that there are significant positive effects of project leaders\u2019 resilience and self-esteem on their self-efficacy, and that project leaders\u2019 resilience and self-efficacy is significantly mediated by their self-esteem.

Noor, Hesty Susanti, Miranti I. Mandasari, ","Tahun":2021,"Abstrak":"Quantitative evaluation of stroke patients with the risk of swallowing disorder or dysphagia is required to support diagnosis and further rehabilitation planning. Fluoroscopy X-ray imaging usually is used for swallowing diagnosis, though it gives radiation exposure to patients. Therefore, quantification of muscle coordination patterns involved in swallowing based on surface electromyography (sEMG) was introduced. However, an adequate quantification of sEMG for dysphagia diagnosis still lacks standardization. In this work, potential sEMG signal features, namely the contraction duration (DUR), the time to peak of maximum contraction (TTP), and the total RMS power (TP), were further investigated to evaluate the swallowing processes in healthy subjects and post-stroke patients. The experimental scheme instructed the participant, i.e. 20 healthy subjects and 20 patients, to swallow 3 mL of water in normal swallowing mode and swallow saliva in dry swallowing mode. The proposed signal processing procedure helps to establish the feature extraction of the three features mentioned earlier. For dysphagia assessment, with the support of our proposed signal processing procedure, DUR and TTP can be used together to improve diagnosis reliability. The characteristic of both features in healthy subjects was shorter than in post-stroke patients. Also, the TP feature is useful as additional information to evaluate the role of suprahyoid (SUP) and infrahyoid (INF) muscle groups which are very important in the swallowing process. These results are promising to provide a reliable set of features in the time domain for swallowing analysis. Notably, this can also be utilized as a feature for supporting the automatic classification of dysphagia diagnosis. \u00a9 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

The Secondary data testing to determine the effect partially and simultaneously was done using a panel data regression. Panel data regression results shows one point Debt to Equity Ratio (DER) and Earning per Share (EPS) can reduce stock returns, then one point Return on Equity (ROE) can increase stock returns partially.

This disease becomes a serious problem because of the high resistance of Plasmodium parasite against the well-established antimalarial agents, such as Artemisinin. Hence, new potent compounds are urgently needed to resolve this resistance problem. In the present study, we investigated cycloguanil analogues as a potent antimalarial agent by utilizing several studies, i.e., comparative of molecular field analysis (CoMFA), molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A CoMFA model with five partial least square regressions (PLSR) was developed to predict the pIC50value of the compound by utilizing a data set of 42 cycloguanil analogues. From statistical analysis, we obtained the r2values of the training and test sets that were 0.85 and 0.70, respectively, while q2of the leave-one-out cross-validation was 0.77. The contour maps of the CoMFA model were also interpreted to analyze the structural requirement regarding electrostatic and steric factors. The most active compound (c33) and least active compound (c8) were picked for molecular docking and MD analysis. From the docking analysis, we found that the attached substituent on the backbone structure of cycloguanil gives a significant contribution to antimalarial activity. The results of the MD simulation confirm the stability of the binding pose obtained from the docking simulations. \u00a9 2021, Gadjah Mada University.

However, the narrow and tortuous cerebrovasculature complicates image-based assessment, especially when quantifying relative pressure. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of image-based cerebrovascular relative pressure mapping, investigating the accuracy of the routinely used reduced Bernoulli (RB), the extended unsteady Bernoulli (UB), and the full-field virtual work-energy relative pressure ((Formula presented.)

Cerebrovascular relative pressures were also derived in 4D Flow MRI from healthy volunteers ((Formula presented.)), acquired at two spatial resolutions (dx = 1.1 and 0.8 mm). Results: The in silico analysis indicate that accurate relative pressure estimations are inherently coupled to spatial sampling: at dx = 1.0 mm high errors are reported for all methods; at dx = 0.5 mm (Formula presented.) WERP recovers relative pressures at a mean error of 0.02 \u00b1 0.25 mm Hg, while errors remain higher for RB and UB (mean error of \u22122.18 \u00b1 1.91 and \u22122.18 \u00b1 1.87 mm Hg, respectively).

Methods: To assess whether there were differences in noise pollution before and during COVID-19. In this paper, we use various statistical methods following odds ratios, Wilcoxon and Fisher\u2019s tests and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with various comparisons of prior selection. The outcome of interest for a parameter in Bayesian inference is complete posterior distribution. Roughly, the mean of the posterior will be clear with point approximation.

However, when optical signals propagate through optical fibers, disturbances occur as the transmission distance increases. These disturbances affect the system performance indicated by the deteriorating transmission data quality in terms of the quality factor (Q-factor) and bit error rate. These parameters are vulnerable to certain factors that can alter signal transmissions such as fiber attenuation, group velocity dispersion (GVD), and self-phase modulation (SPM) as a nonlinear effect. In this study, the effects of these factors on a single-channel, single-mode fiber are investigated using a bit rate of 10 Gbps at various transmission distances and source power levels. The parametric study of attenuation, GVD, and SPM with non-return-to-zero (NRZ) modulation format are considered at various transmission distances, from 10 to 100 km, and input powers of 5 and 10 dBm are simulated using OptiSystem to characterize the parameters of Q-factor and received power.

It utilizes for diseases with discrete, limited-time courses, such as outbreaks of acute infections. The major drawback of CFR is it can only be considered as a final result when all the cases have been accomplished (either died or recovered).

The role of expert audit opinion is becoming increasingly important in terms of supporting a company's reputation. This study aims to determine the effect of corporate social performance and higher academic education on audit opinion. This study used the cost of corporate social responsibility to determine the corporate social performance. The audit opinion assessed in this paper was a going concern audit opinion. The companies referred to in this study were high-profile, low-profile companies, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), and Privately-Owned Enterprises (POEs). This study examined 583 observation-years of companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2018 period. This study found that there was a negative effect of social performance on going-concern audit opinion. The finding showed that the auditors had doubts about the viability of the business of the company with low social performance. This evidence was found in high-profile and low-profile companies, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), as well as Privately-Owned Enterprises (POEs). High-profile and low-profile companies, SOEs, and POEs are expected to always strive to increase social and environmental awareness. Superior social performance is usually associated with lower regulatory risks, litigation, and external reputation for both the client company and the auditor. Superior social performance also signified ethical and responsible management. On the other hand, higher academic education also played a significant and positive role with the audit opinion. This study provides evidence regarding the effect of social performance on the assessment of audit risk to decide the audit opinion to be determined by the auditor. \u00a9 2021 RIGEO.

The ESP consists of cash assistance, utility discount, moratorium, Employee Provident Fund (EPF) cash withdrawals, credit guarantee scheme and wage subsidies. A survey carried out by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) shows that households prefer different types of financial assistance. These preferences forge the need to effectively customise ESPs to manage the economic burden among low-income households. In this study, a recommender system for such ESPs was designed by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. Methods: This study used a dataset from DOSM titled 'Effects of COVID-19 on the Economy and Individual - Round 2,' collected from April 10 to April 24, 2020. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining was followed to develop machine learning models to classify ESP receivers according to their preferred subsidies types. Four machine learning techniques-Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Na\u00efve Bayes-were used to build the predictive models for each moratorium, utility discount and EPF and Private Remuneration Scheme (PRS) cash withdrawals subsidies. The best predictive model was selected based on F-score metrics. Results: Among the four machine learning techniques, Gradient Boosted Tree outperformed the rest. This technique predicted the following: moratorium preferences with 93.8% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 87.6% F-score; utilities discount with 86% sensitivity, 82.1% precision and 84% F-score; and EPF and PRS with 83.6% sensitivity, 81.2% precision and 82.4% F-score. Households that prefer moratorium subsidies did not favour other financial aids except for cash assistance.

For example, the mean absolute percent error decreases from 0.25 to 0.12 corresponding to heights 10 to 300 m, respectively for the 6th future hour prediction, an improvement of around 50%. The performance of ANN method is compared with hybrid genetic algorithm and ANN method namely GANN. Results showed that GANN outperformed ANN for most of the heights for prediction of wind speed at the future 6th hour.

Presently, water quality is carried out through laboratory experiments, which requires costly reagents, skilled labor, and consumes time. Thereby making it necessary to search for an alternative method. Recently, machine learning tools have been successfully implemented in the monitoring, estimation, and predictions of river water quality index to provide an alternative solution to the limitations of laboratory analytical methods. In this study, the potentials of one of the machine learning tools (artificial neural network) were explored in the predictions and estimation of the Kelantan River basin. Water quality data collected from the 14 stations of the River basin was used for modeling and predicting (WQP). As for WQP analysis, the results obtained from this study show that the best prediction was obtained from the prediction of pH. The low kurtosis values of pH indicate that the appearance of outliers give a negative impact on the performance.

A parametric study is conducted to analyze the influence of variation in some design parameters on the system's performance.

This metacognitive ability is also called self-regulation of learning (SRL). The importance of SRL in education has been becoming a motivating factor for many researchers to develop the measurement model for students' SRL behaviour. One of the SRL measurement models in online learning is Online Self-regulated Learning Questionnaire (OSLQ), developed by Bernard et al.(2008). Several studies have tested, adapted and translated the OSLQ in different contexts. However, none of these studies assessed the OSLQ in online-collaborative learning environments, especially in Indonesia. PURPOSE The current study aims to assess the OSLQ measurement model's fitness in an Indonesian online collaborative learning environment. The result of this study will provide additional evidence to the validity of OSLQ as an instrument for measuring SRL in online learning, particularly for online collaborative learning. METHODS We collected questionnaire (Online Self-regulated Learning questionnaire) data from 277 students. We perform confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) through R studio software to assess the model's fitness to the data. As the indicators for the good of fitness of the model, we used several indices, like CFI, LTI, RMSEA, SRMR and Chisq\/df ratio. OUTCOMES Based on the result of CFA, we obtained the value for each index as follow, Chisq\/df = 1.66, CFI = 0.926, TLI= 0.914, RMSEA = 0.055, and SRMR = 0.065. All the indicators showed that the OSLQ model has the goodness of fit to the data. CONCLUSIONS Based on these findings, we can conclude that the OSLQ can be used d as a measurement model for online collaborative learning.

Based on this test, PPKM showed a significant effect on the addition of daily new cases and recovered cases. Conversely, the vaccination program only had a significant impact on recovered cases. A forecast of the COVID-19 cases was conducted and indicated that the daily new cases showed a negative trend, although it fluctuated for the next 7 days, while death and recovered cases continued to increase. Hence, it can be said that the vaccination program has still not shown its effectiveness in decreasing the number of daily new cases while PPKM is quite effective in suppressing new cases. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

IDC can spread to other areas of the body such as liver, lungs and even bones. The process of identifying and categorizing breast cancer sub-types accurately is a very important clinical task. IDC Diagnosis requires extremely serious measures, such as surgery and radiation therapy. Diagnosis based on pathological imagery is no less difficult, requiring a microscope and manual learning to classify it as positive or negative cancer. This process is very time consuming and conveys many errors due to human cognitive limitations. The existence of a system which can automatically perform such work, is expected to save time and reduce the error rate diagnose. This study proposed IDC and Non IDC classification by analyzing the Breast Histopathology Images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method. The dataset consisted of 1020 IDC images, the same number is also used for Non-IDC. The model was composed of CNN with three hidden layers plus one fully connected layer with sigmoid activation. An evaluation is carried out to see the performance of the proposed method by using a matrix of precision, recall, F1, and accuracy.

It also aims to investigate the weaknesses and obstacles that lecturers must overcome in order to teach an online class. This research applies a mixed-method approach. Lecturers were surveyed through online preparedness questionnaires, and several themes were constructed from the gathered qualitative data. The results show that lecturers have strong baseline technical skills to use e-learning platforms for online courses; they have quickly adapted to using a Learning Management System (LMS), and most have a tactical solution for most online classes with insufficient feasibility, but they do not have a strategic solution.

Generally, GE was produced by burning fossil fuels such as gasoline in the combustion engine. Gasoline has higher air toxic emissions than ethanol. Hence, the investigation of ethanol has gained attention. On the other hand, biomass has become a renewable source of ethanol. However, due to the rigid structure of biomass, biomass pretreatment is needed before the hydrolysis and fermentation process. Recently, growing attention has been devoted to applying ionic liquids (ILs)-assisted pretreatment despite the high-cost process. Therefore, in this study, to optimize the ethanol production from biomass, the simulation using SuperPro Designer (SPD) software was conducted. Bagasse as biomass material was treated by IL, namely choline acetate (ChOAc), with the range of ratio IL\/biomass of 0-1.5. The developed SPD model was validated with published data. The results indicated that the minimum ratio of IL\/biomass was 1.3. When in the hydrolysis performed at high-loading after 72 h reaction time, the glucose and xylose concentrations were 49 g\/L and 13 g\/L, respectively. When the fermentation process was conducted, the initial mixed sugar solution concentration was 23 g\/L of glucose and 6 g\/L of xylose. Then, the ethanol concentration was 15 g\/L at 24 h, which was 89% of the theoretical ethanol yield.

Of the various activities in the construction sector, each activity can have an impact on the environment. Sustainability supply chain (SSCM) is a concept in the supply chain process that pays attention to three aspects, namely social, economic, and environmental in carrying out supply chain activities. This SSCM concept integrates these three aspects to obtain a sustainable supply chain process. Evaluation of material management activities, especially social and environmental aspects in the supply chain, can be measured through a supply chain performance sustainability approach. This study uses the Sustainable Balanced Scorecard model to map the supply chain strategy and the Supply Chain Operational Reference model to map business processes and determine metrics and ISO 14001 as a clause for the work environment. Based on the integration of the two models, a performance measurement metric is obtained which is used as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) in measuring a sustainable supply chain. Based on the perspective of the BSC model, the research in this research uses three BSC perspectives, namely the financial perspective, the internal business process perspective, and the learning and growth perspective. These three perspectives were chosen based on the company's material management business processes. All company strategies that have been mapped into the previous BSC perspective are remapped with an overview of the relationship between strategies across perspectives. The priority vector shows the weight of each criterion from the matrix.

Drowsiness can trigger various problems, such as decreasing productivity, damaging emotions, even to the point of causing serious accidents, both on the highway or in the workplace environment. One possible\u00a0way to detect drowsiness is by using\u00a0an Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. EEG is a test used to evaluate the electrical activity in the brain. This research proposed a system that can detect drowsiness based on EEG signal using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) as feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) as classification method of drowsy and normal conditions. At a preliminary stage, the system would perform a\u00a0pre-processing to minimize noise signals using normalization and grounding magnitude. Feature extraction of these EEG signals\u00a0was\u00a0then decomposed using DWT function whereas the\u00a0K-NN method is used to classify the EEG signals either in normal or drowsy conditions. The K-NN is done by Euclidean Distance Method. The private dataset consists of 60 signals, divided into 30 signals to normal and drowsy\u00a0each. This research used DWT with eight-level decomposition of Alpha and Beta signals, and 3 wavelet family types (Coiflet, Symlet and Biorthogonal). Based on the results of tests conducted, EEG signals was decomposed using 3 different types of wavelet family generally provides accuracy values that are not much of a\u00a0difference\u00a0while selecting different K values for K-NN classification affects the accuracy. In conclusion, the value of k = 5 is the optimum value to classify normal dan drowsy condition. This condition is in accordance with the K-NN theory in which\u00a0a\u00a0greater k value can reduce noise in the classification process so it can improve accuracy of the system.

This study aims to explore the potential of Islamic boarding schools as places to support and to empower the economy and to increase the participation of students in entrepreneurial activities by applying the Humane Entrepreneurship approach. This study identifies the humane entrepreneurship approach by analyzing the humane cycle and the enterprise cycle in the entrepreneurship activities occurring in a single case study of an Islamic boarding school. Design\/methodology\/approach: This article used a qualitative method with a case study approach through deep exploration and observation. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with the key people in one of the Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia using a purposive sampling technique. Miles and Huberman (1984) technique was used for data analysis by grouping similar text segments into codes and categorizing them for further analysis. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that the Islamic boarding school has implemented humane entrepreneurship through entrepreneurial-oriented activities as the main aspects of the humane cycle and the enterprise cycle. The implementation of humane entrepreneurship aims to achieve entrepreneurial growth, innovation and independence of the Islamic boarding school, as well as the development of the stakeholder's capabilities, knowledge and commitment. In addition, applying the spiritual approach, which is one of the important components of Islamic boarding schools, has proven to be effective in implementing humane entrepreneurship. Research limitations\/implications: This study has several limitations. First, this study only focused on one Islamic boarding school in Indonesia. Second, there is still very little research in the field of humane entrepreneurship, so the concept itself is still considered to be relatively new.

With 2.5 billion people at risk of acquiring the infection around the world, disease severity is influenced by the immunological status of the individual, seronegative or seropositive, prior to natural infection. Caused by four antigenically related but distinct serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4, infection by one serotype confers life-long immunity to that serotype and a period of temporary cross-immunity (TCI) to other serotypes. The clinical response on exposure to a second serotype is complex with the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) process, a disease augmentation phenomenon when pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection do not neutralize but rather enhance the new infection, used to explain the etiology of severe disease. In this paper, we present a minimalistic mathematical model framework developed to describe qualitatively the dengue immunological response mediated by antibodies. Three models are analyzed and compared: (i) primary dengue infection, (ii) secondary dengue infection with the same (homologous) dengue virus and (iii) secondary dengue infection with a different (heterologous) dengue virus. We explore the features of viral replication, antibody production and infection clearance over time. The model is developed based on body cells and free virus interactions resulting in infected cells activating antibody production. Our mathematical results are qualitatively similar to the ones described in the empiric immunology literature, providing insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe disease.

The amount and activity of BAT are inversely correlated with body-mass index and body fat percentage. Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) plays a role in the differentiation and development of BAT, which can be increased by bioactive compounds from several medicinal plants. Moringa oleifera (MO) leaves are rich with vitamin, minerals, and bioactive compounds and have been used for treating obesity-related diseases in the past. The aim of this study was to explore the potency of MO leaf extract (MOLE) to modulate BAT differentiation in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Materials and Methods: Twenty-four, 5-week-old male Deutsche Denken Yoken mice (Mus musculus) were randomly divided into four groups: The normal chow diet group was fed a normal diet, the HFD group was fed a HFD, the HFD+MOLE1, and the HFD+MOLE2 groups were fed HFD and MOLE in a dose of 280 and 560 mg\/kg body weight (BW)\/day, respectively. The experiment was performed for 7 weeks. At the end of the experiment, histological analysis was performed on the interscapular BAT, and blood was drawn for BMP7 protein levels.

Therefore, the study examines the income-induced EKC and Chinese outward foreign direct investment (FDI)-based PHH in the multivariate framework of people\u2019s connectivity and technology innovation in B&RCs from 2003 to 2018. The outcome of the study reveals that the observed relationship is quantile-dependent, which may disclose misleading results in previous studies using traditional methodologies that address the averages.

The Chinese outward FDI flows increase carbon emissions at medium to high emission countries, thereby confirming PHH. The findings also indicate that people\u2019s connectivity contributes to increasing emissions while innovation mitigates carbon emissions at lower to medium polluted countries. Moreover, the outcomes of Granger causality confirm one-way causality between economic growth and CO2emissions, between FDI and CO2emissions, between people\u2019s connectivity and CO2emissions, and between innovation and CO2emissions.

Stability analysis is done for the first three equilibria. Furthermore, a condition for coexistence equilibrium is obtained, which gives a condition for bifurcation analysis. Numerical simulations were carried out to obtain a stable limit-cycle resulting from two Hopf bifurcation points with dengue transmission rate and COVID-19 transmission rate as the bifurcation parameter, representing a stable periodic coexistence of dengue and COVID-19 transmission.

An increase of vocal activity during the mating period in the late winter was revealed, including percussive signallings of grey seals. The ambient sound spectra showed that in the current shallow sea conditions ship traffic noise contributed more in the higher frequency bands. Thus, a 500 Hz one-third octave band was chosen as an indicator frequency band for anthropogenic noise in the monitoring area. It was shown that changes in the soundscape occurring during the freezing period create favourable conditions for ship noise propagation at larger distances. Based on the monitoring data, the environmental risks related to the anthropogenic sound around the monitoring sites were considered as low. However, further analysis showed that for a small percentage of time the ship traffic can cause auditory masking for the ringed seals. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Swarm UAVs, however, need to plan paths through the atmosphere, effectively preventing any collision that can occur when flying a multiple UAV simultaneously. This study proposes to design an anti-collision and a path planning system of swarm UAVs by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The ABC algorithm is an optimization method inspired by the foraging behavior of honeybees. The self-organization trait of honeybees enables them to coordinate themselves to create a global and local optimum. The proposed system, however, uses the ABC algorithm to optimize UAV's velocity, i.e., to reach its destination efficiently in the shortest path while avoiding collision among drones. The establishment of a constraint of a minimum acceptable distance among UAVs enables the algorithm to search for an alternative path in avoiding a collision. The simulation, however, reveals a successful convergence of a swarm UAVs towards a destination with no collision. During the trial with 12 and 20 drones, for instance, all UAVs successfully arrive at their goals with 0 potential collisions. However, during the test with 50 drones, there are 12 possible collisions. Once swarm drones reach their goal position at rest, the cluster will not overlap with other agents, as demonstrated in the visualization. Therefore, the ABC algorithm has satisfied the success criteria for this project and is suitable for swarm drone applications. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.","abstrakClean":"rapid advancement wireless communication sensor battery technology swarm unmanned aerial vehicle uavs widely used traffic surveillance military application swarm uavs however need plan path atmosphere effectively preventing collision occur flying multiple uav simultaneously study proposes design anticollision path planning system swarm uavs using artificial bee colony abc algorithm abc algorithm optimization method inspired foraging behavior honeybee selforganization trait honeybee enables coordinate create global local optimum proposed system however us abc algorithm optimize uavs velocity ie reach destination efficiently shortest path avoiding collision among drone establishment constraint minimum acceptable distance among uavs enables algorithm search alternative path avoiding collision simulation however reveals successful convergence swarm uavs towards destination collision trial drone instance uavs successfully arrive goal potential collision however test drone possible collision swarm drone reach goal position rest cluster overlap agent demonstrated visualization therefore abc algorithm satisfied success criterion project suitable swarm drone application ieee","aspects":["SDG3"]},{"Judul":"Indonesia in facing new normal: An evidence hybrid forecasting of covid-19 cases using mlp, nnar and elm","Penulis":"Toni Toharudin, Resa Septiani Pontoh, Rezzy Eko Caraka, Solichatus Zahroh, Antony Akbar, Bens Pardamean, Rung Ching Chen, ","Tahun":2021,"Abstrak":"Since COVID-19 spread to hundreds of countries, it has become a global pandemic. This pandemic is spreading rapidly through the human transmission. To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the government has issued various guidelines regarding restrictions on human activity. Jakarta and West Java are two provinces that had a fairly high rate of spread when COVID-19 began to appear. To reduce the rate of spread, local governments in each province have issued a Large Scale Social Restriction (PSBB) policy. After the implementation of this policy, there was a significant decrease in the addition of new cases in the two provinces. Therefore, the government replaced this policy with a new normal policy as well as to address economic problems in society. This new normal policy actually led to the emergence of new cases as a result of failure to follow government-set health protocols. This study examines whether there are significant differences in the movement of COVID-19 cases across the two provinces. In addition, this study examines how the incidence rate of COVID-19 will move in the future using various NN (Neural Network) methods such as MPL, NNAR and ELM. The results show that there was a significant decrease in the Jakarta region before and after the implementation of the PSBB, but it did not occur in West Java province.

The objective of measuring profitability with gross profit is to reckon how efficient an enterprise manages the labors and supplies in carrying out the production process or services provision. In allocating COGS for product profitability analysis, Activity-Based Costing (ABC) is a costing technique that allows cost allocation based on the activities carried out in the production process. Companies from various industries have adopted ABC with available supporting tools like ERP system. This paper will discuss a case study of a telecommunications company in Indonesia that implements SAP S\/4HANA for the cost allocation with ABC and profitability analysis processes. The company still faces shortcomings in its daily business operation, particularly profitability analysis reporting. The current COGS report for profitability analysis in the implemented system does not provide information about the source of the cost allocation, thus causing it hard to trace and further analyze the cost of activities contributing to the production of a product. Report customization can be a solution to accommodate the information needed.

The prediction was carried out using six Ensemble Methods, i.e., Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Extra Tree, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Categorical Boosting. Feature selection was carried out by calculating the correlation between feature and target according to statistical parameters, i.e., ANOVA, Mutual Information (MI), and a combination of ANOVA and MI. We obtained the prediction model that outperformed the related studies for two similar data sets with the value of accuracy for the GSE10072, GSE19804, and GSE19188 data sets 100%, 97.22%, and 100%, respectively \u00a9 2022 Fhira Nhita and Isman Kurniawan.

Nevertheless, this C-RAN concept's main challenge lies in the need for a fronthaul network to handle high capacity and low delay. The Radio over Fiber (RoF) has been a solution to satisfy the high capacity and high-speed transmission required by the 5G fronthaul network. Keeping the attenuation effect low to achieve the minimum BER by using the optical amplifier is necessary. This paper investigates RoF by considering amplifier placement and different bitrate with 16-QAM modulation for Indonesia's 5G Fronthaul Network Implementation. Optical amplifier placement scenarios are pre-amplifier and booster amplifier. The results show that the booster amplifier scheme can cover a maximum fronthaul transmission distance of 20 km. As a comparison, the pre-amplifier scheme can reach a transmission distance of up to 15 km. Moreover, increasing the bitrate from 1 Gbps to 2.5 Gbps causes the BER value to increase. This result shows that different optical amplifiers and the increase in bit rate will affect the obtained BER values and limit the transmission distance that the fronthaul network can achieve.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.","abstrakClean":"g network cloud radio access network cran play substantial role escalating network performance efficiency nevertheless cran concept main challenge lie need fronthaul network handle high capacity low delay radio fiber rof solution satisfy high capacity highspeed transmission required g fronthaul network keeping attenuation effect low achieve minimum ber using optical amplifier necessary paper investigates rof considering amplifier placement different bitrate qam modulation indonesia g fronthaul network implementation optical amplifier placement scenario preamplifier booster amplifier result show booster amplifier scheme cover maximum fronthaul transmission distance km comparison preamplifier scheme reach transmission distance km moreover increasing bitrate gbps gbps cause ber value increase result show different optical amplifier increase bit rate affect obtained ber value limit transmission distance fronthaul network achieve ieee","aspects":["SDG1","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"An evidence-based culture: COVID-19 positivity factors during the asymptomatic occurrence in Jakarta, lndonesia","Penulis":"Bahrul Ilmi Nasution, Yudhistira Nugraha, Andi Sulasikin, Hansen Wiguna, Juan Intan Kanggrawan, Alex Lukmanto Suherman, Ngabila Salama, Dwi Oktavia, ","Tahun":2022,"Abstrak":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global disaster, with over 746,312 confirmed cases and still counting in Indonesia, especially Jakarta, which has about 50 per cent asymptomatic confirmed cases.

Important things in an aquarium system are the level of ammonia in the water and the temperature of the water. Other research proposes several systems to make the aquarium control system robust for the aquarium monitoring and control system. However, those systems have weaknesses; namely, the user must actively access information to the server. This paper proposes a robust aquarium control system using the decision tree regression (DTR) algorithm. The development of this system was to overcome the problem of aquarium control by remote users. An accurate and real-time system is needed to monitor the aquarium so that it does not reach dangerous and critical points, such as in the case of an increase in water temperature. We did tests by developing an aquarium system connected to a server and an application that acts as a controller. Our measurements check the delay of sending data from the sensor to the server, process delay, actuator delay, user delay, and delay in reaching the aquarium's critical point. The measurement of the system's robustness is by calculating the probability of the information arrival to the user in the period of the critical point compared to the time needed to reach the critical point. Furthermore, we also made an analytical model based on the probability density function of the delay covered in this system.

However, identification of many native coins is still a challenge to this day, especially for those found in Indonesia. This study aims to re-examine a particular coin type made of tin-lead alloy with suspected copper content, reported to be found in the Musi river in south Sumatra. Available literature presumed the coin as a Siak issue, based on rather unsatisfactory reading of its inscription. While native Malay coins typically used Arabic Jawi for their inscription, the coin is unusual in using Indic script that can be described as a transitional form between late Kawi and early Modern Javanese, somewhat inclined towards the former. Through letterform comparison with artefacts such as N\u012btis\u0101rasamuccaya, this author proposes a revised reading of pang\u00e9ran ratu hing jambi, making this coin attributable to Jambi. The commercial success of the early 17th century Jambi sultanate and the propensity of its court to emulate Javanese-ness seemingly support this attribution. A narrower date range, however, could not be drawn as the inscription provides little orthographic or linguistic indications. Analogy with contemporaneous Banten copper coins suggests that the Jambi coin may have been used as a prestige item rather than common currency. \u00a9 2022 Editors, Indonesia and the Malay World.","abstrakClean":"malay archipelago rich numismatic legacy however identification many native coin still challenge day especially found indonesia study aim reexamine particular coin type made tinlead alloy suspected copper content reported found musi river south sumatra available literature presumed coin siak issue based rather unsatisfactory reading inscription native malay coin typically used arabic jawi inscription coin unusual using indic script described transitional form late kawi early modern javanese somewhat inclined towards former letterform comparison artefact n\u012btis\u0101rasamuccaya author proposes revised reading pang\u00e9ran ratu hing jambi making coin attributable jambi commercial success early th century jambi sultanate propensity court emulate javaneseness seemingly support attribution narrower date range however could drawn inscription provides little orthographic linguistic indication analogy contemporaneous banten copper coin suggests jambi coin may used prestige item rather common currency editor indonesia malay world","aspects":["SDG1","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Implementation of Robotic Process Automation for Sentiment Analysis of Lecturer Evaluation by Students (EDOM) at Higher Education Information System","Penulis":"Dariosany Nur Iqlal Rahman, Rachmadita Andreswari, Rokhman Fauzi, ","Tahun":2022,"Abstrak":"The same and repetitive business processes of today's era are extremely inefficient.

We performed three models with different SVM kernels, i.e., linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial. The model performance was validated using both internal and external data. The validation results show that the RBF model produced the best result, with the $R^{2}$ values of the training and test sets of 0.98 and 0.84, respectively, while $Q^{2}$ of the leave-one-out cross-validation was 0.85.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.","abstrakClean":"malaria dangerous endemic disease infects million yearly plasmodium falciparum specie responsible malaria death currently available antimalarial drug le effective due increased parasite resistance drug hence novel antimalarial agent high efficiency inhibit malaria urgently needed falcipain enzyme promising target protein developing new antimalaria however conventional laboratory testing design new drug take time expensive therefore quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar used accelerate drug design process study developed qsar model using genetic algorithmsupport vector machine gasvm predict pic value falcipain inhibitor ga utilized feature selection method svm optimized hyperparameter used develop prediction model performed three model different svm kernel ie linear radial basis function rbf polynomial model performance validated using internal external data validation result show rbf model produced best result r value training test set respectively q leaveoneout crossvalidation ieee","aspects":["SDG3"]},{"Judul":"Critical Success Factors of E-Learning for Health Learning Platform in Health Organization","Penulis":"Zulfa Ulinuha, Sinung Suakanto, Edi Triono Nuryatno, Ekky Novriza Alam, ","Tahun":2022,"Abstrak":"E-learning encourages students to be more involved with content and more actively involved in learning that can be controlled by themselves.

This communication reduce the workload of the base station and increase network capacity.

To overcome this problem, power allocation needs to be done using Deep Neural Network (DNN) to overcome non-convex problems in maximizing sum-rate and energy efficiency. DNN can be considered a universal approach that can determine the best scheme in the system because it adapt to different environments and can replace the iterative method such as Convex Approximation (CA) based algorithm. This research aims to provide that power allocation using DNN can improve the performance of CA-based algorithm. An increment in the number of CUEs will be seen in sum-rate and energy efficiency. Simulation results show that an increment of CUEs increase sum-rate and energy efficiency. Besides that, DNN can approach the performance of the CA-based algorithm with accuracy above 98%, and improve 2% performance of the CA-based algorithm. DNN is more suitable to implement because it can improve the performance of the CA-based algorithm and can be implemented in different environment because there is learning process in DNN where the model can predict the output based on the input entered.

As time passes, the discovery of conflicts within the football industry has also become increasingly diverse; both affected in-game or out of the game. In 2015, Indonesia had no activity in football for almost a year when the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) banned the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) from competing in international competitions until the conflict among their internal agents was resolved. The agents involved in this highly controversial ban include the Commission 10 of the Parliament of Indonesia, the National Sports Committee of Indonesia (KONI), the Indonesian President, and the Ministry of Youth and Sport of Indonesia. Conflict resolution strategies outside the football games are delicate and more challenging to overcome due to the involvement of the government and various governing bodies. This opens to higher unpredictability in modeling the conflict situations, hence a lower possibility of a successful conflict resolution model strategy. In addressing this gap, this paper proposes a new Computational Intelligence approach based on the Soft Set Theory, where an alternative algorithm is derived from modeling the conflict situations. We then delineated the proposed algorithm for an instructional example of the Indonesian football conflict situation in 2015 concerning the Indonesia Football Super League. The results showed that the proposed algorithm successfully handled conflict and recommended the Indonesian football agents involved, including PSSI and FIFA. \u00a9 2022.

These negative impacts include the place of disease transmission, causing environmental pollution and health problems. Many general hospitals still do not have an integrated non-medical waste management system that supports green hospitals. The non-medical waste management process, from the preparation to reporting stages, is still done manually. This manual process can cause several problems, such as non-medical waste monitoring, which cannot be done regularly, and the recording of the waste generated and the waste that has been managed is prone to errors.

Chuang, Tati Rajab Mengko, ","Tahun":2022,"Abstrak":"The sequential labeling model is commonly used for time series or sequence data where each instance label is classified using previous instance label. In this work, a sequential labeling model is proposed as a new approach to detect the type and index mutations simultaneously, using DNA sequences from lung cancer study cases. The methods used are One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU). Each nucleotide in the patient's DNA sequence is classified as either normal or with a certain type of mutation in which case, its index mutation is predicted. The mutation types detected are either substitution, insertion, deletion, or delins (deletion insertion) mutations. Based on the experiments that were conducted using EGFR gene, BiLSTM and Bi-GRU displayed better performance and were more stable than 1D-CNN. Further tests were carried out on the TP53, KRAS, CTNNB1, SMARCA4, CDKN2A, PTPRD, BRAF, ERBB2, and PTPRT gene. The proposed model reports F1-scores of 0.9596, and 0.9612 using Bi-GRU and BiLSTM, respectively. Based on the results the model can successfully detect the type and index mutations in the DNA sequence more accurately and faster without the need for other supporting data and tools, and does not require re-alignment to reference sequences. This will greatly facilitate the user in detecting type and index mutations faster by entering only the DNA sequence. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

However, increased work engagement can potentially trigger work-family conflict and lead to employees\u2019 withdrawal, even employees turnover. It is necessary to explore family functions to fill the existing theoretical and practical gap. Therefore, the present study aims to analyze the relationship among family, work engagement, and turnover intention by considering the family as a sources source of both conflict and support. To this end, this study surveyed non-manager and staff-level employees in pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia. Analyzed using SEM covariance procedure with AMOS 23 software, this study found that family plays dual roles in affecting employees\u2019 work engagement. Increased work engagement was found to result in a lower turnover intention yet increasing work-family conflict. Increased sales, working hours, and targets are among the factors leading to work-family conflict. Work engagement is a double-edged sword that should be handled carefully through communication and stress management interventions. Activities like family gathering programs are also recommended to minimize work-family conflict and improve family support.

Early diagnosis determines the prognosis. This study aimed to develop a risk assessment tool for early detection of ovarian cancer using artificial intelligence. To accomplish this, the presence of ten signs and symptoms reported by patients with ovarian cancer was assessed. Methods: This study was carried out as a cohort study of patients diagnosed with suspected ovarian tumors undergoing cytoreduction operation at Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, from December 2019 to September 2020. Compared to ovarian cancer self-assessment through questionnaire, postoperative histopathology in patients with suspected ovarian tumors. The questionnaire proceeded by artificial intelligence is grouped into risk and no risk. Statistical analyses were done using Chi-Square and Exact Fisher Test. Result: In total, 115 patients included in this study. The differences were statistically significant in terms of the six variables (abdominal bloating, nausea\/vomiting, decreased of appetite, fullness, menstrual disturbance, and weight loss) ovarian cancer self-assessment compared to postoperative histopathology with a tendency towards benign ovarian tumors (p<0.05), while there was no statistically significant difference in the four variables (abdominal enlargement, abdominal pain, urinating disturbance, and defecation disturbance) (p>0.05). According to the artificial intelligence grouping, fifty-five patients were at risk, and sixty patients were not at risk. The Fifty-five risk patients were related with postoperative histopathology diagnosis (with RR 0.682 and CI 95% 0.519-0.895).

Due to various issues like gender discrimination, women's self-sustainability is quite low, and this accounts for the negligible contribution of women in Pakistan's economy (up to 20 to 25%). In addressing this issue, the current study adopted a quantitative research approach and cross-sectional research design. By using a survey questionnaire, data were collected from female clients of microfinance institutions during May 1, 2018 to August 30, 2018. SmartPLS 3 was utilized to analyse the data. The results of the inquiry revealed that microfinance institutions have an essential role to play in promoting women's self-reliance. With the help of micro-enterprises for women, services offered by microfinance institution such as micro-credit, micro-savings, micro-insurance, micro-training and social capital have a major role in developing women's self-sustainability. However, an environmental disaster is one of the crucial factors, which limits the positive contribution of microfinance institutions towards women's self-sustainability. Our thorough research and knowledge on the subject indicates that the current study is the pioneer study that has investigated microfinance institutions as major facilitators of women's self-reliance but which has been limited by many factors such as environmental disasters.

Rajab, ","Tahun":2022,"Abstrak":"One common type of vascular dementia (VaD) is poststroke dementia (PSD). Vascular dementia can occur in one-third of stroke patients. The worsening of cognitive function can occur quickly if not detected and treated early. One of the potential medical modalities for observing this disorder by considering costs and safety factors is electroencephalogram (EEG). It is thought that there are differences in the spectral dynamics of the EEG signal between the normal group and stroke patients with cognitive impairment so that it can be used in detection. Therefore, this study proposes an EEG signal characterization method using EEG spectral power complexity measurements to obtain features of poststroke patients with cognitive impairment and normal subjects. Working memory EEGs were collected and analyzed from forty-two participants, consisting of sixteen normal subjects, fifteen poststroke patients with mild cognitive impairment, and eleven poststroke patients with dementia. From the analysis results, it was found that there were differences in the dynamics of the power spectral in each group, where the spectral power of the cognitively impaired group was more regular than the normal group. Notably, (1) significant differences in spectral entropy (SpecEn) with a p value <0.05 were found for all electrodes, (2) there was a relationship between SpecEn values and the severity of dementia (SpecEnDem < SpecEnMCI < SpecEnNormal), and (3) a post hoc multiple comparison test showed significant differences between groups at the F7 electrode. This study shows that spectral complexity analysis can discriminate between normal and poststroke patients with cognitive impairment. For further studies, it is necessary to simulate performance validation so that the proposed approach can be used in the early detection of poststroke dementia and monitoring the development of dementia.  \u00a9 2022 Sugondo Hadiyoso et al.","abstrakClean":"one common type vascular dementia vad poststroke dementia psd vascular dementia occur onethird stroke patient worsening cognitive function occur quickly detected treated early one potential medical modality observing disorder considering cost safety factor electroencephalogram eeg thought difference spectral dynamic eeg signal normal group stroke patient cognitive impairment used detection therefore study proposes eeg signal characterization method using eeg spectral power complexity measurement obtain feature poststroke patient cognitive impairment normal subject working memory eeg collected analyzed fortytwo participant consisting sixteen normal subject fifteen poststroke patient mild cognitive impairment eleven poststroke patient dementia analysis result found difference dynamic power spectral group spectral power cognitively impaired group regular normal group notably significant difference spectral entropy specen p value found electrode relationship specen value severity dementia specendem specenmci specennormal post hoc multiple comparison test showed significant difference group f electrode study show spectral complexity analysis discriminate normal poststroke patient cognitive impairment study necessary simulate performance validation proposed approach used early detection poststroke dementia monitoring development dementia sugondo hadiyoso et al","aspects":["SDG3"]},{"Judul":"USING THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR TO EXPLORE FACTORS RELATED TO CONTRACEPTIVE USE AMONG WOMEN IN REPRODUCTIVE AGE","Penulis":"Retno Heru Setyorini, Ismi Dwi Astuti Nurhaen, Ari Probandari, Eny Lestari, ","Tahun":2022,"Abstrak":"In developing countries, millions of women of reproductive age do not use contraception, while research on factors related to contraceptive use behavior are still lacking.

D2D communication is direct link communication between two communication devices, meaning that communication can occur without going through the base station. However, because communication occurs without going through the base station and D2D users do not have their resources, D2D users simultaneously use the resources owned by Cellular User Equipment (CUE) to communicate and cause interference. Power allocation is optimized to mitigate the interference between D2D users and CUEs and maximize the system's overall sum rate. The traditional power allocation scheme in D2D communication still has problems related to the efficiency of the allocation, coordination of interference, and limitations for operating in real-time systems. This work focuses on designing the Long Short Term Memory with Fully Convolutional Network (LSTM-FCN) algorithm suitable for the power control problem on a D2D underlay communication system with an uplink-side multi-cell scheme. The simulation results show that enhancement of CUE can increase the system's sum rate and energy efficiency. At the same time, enhancement of the D2D pair can also increase the sum rate but decrease energy efficiency. Both LSTM-FCN, LSTM, and FCN can approximate the performance of the conventional scheme (CA-based algorithm).

The prefrontal cortex is a structure in the brain that is located in the frontal lobe.

Therefore, in this study, an analysis of differences in brain activation in healthy elderly (non-stroke) and post-stroke patients with vascular dementia was conducted when performing memory recall work. This study involved seven elderly non-stroke and seven stroke patients with vascular dementia. Brain activity was recorded using a 19-channel clinical electroencephalogram (EEG). The study compared prefrontal cortex activity during an attention test. Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was used to analyze active brain areas. Then the analysis of differences in prefrontal cortex activity between non-stroke patients and those with vascular dementia used a paired T-test.

The national examination aims to determine graduation, national education quality mapping, and also for selection to higher education levels. Over the years the UN has become a benchmark for the standardization of education in Indonesia, meaning that the UN is very much needed to find out the size of the quality of student education and the quality of teaching of a school. The government\u2019s policy regarding the plan to remove the UN system has received public attention. The removal of the UN is planned to be replaced with a competency assessment and character survey. In order to know the public\u2019s sentiments regarding this policy, research needs to be done, one of which is to analyze public sentiment through social media Twitter. In text mining tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis, careful selection of a term weighting scheme (TWS) can have a significant impact on effectiveness. We tested the effectiveness of six classification algorithms by varying the TWS in the dataset obtained from Twitter. The experimental results showed that overall TF-IGM outperformed TF-IDF on four classification algorithms.

The real-time cloud observation by weather satellites Himawari-8 has enabled researchers to develop a nowcasting method (short-term prediction) to identify rainfall events in advance, namely the Rapidly Developing Cumulus Area (RDCA) method. The RDCA index, which is the product of the RDCA method, is the probability of occurrence of heavy rainfall. It has been evaluated and successfully utilized in Japan. However, the performance of the RDCA in the tropics has not been assessed yet. Indonesia \u2014as a tropical country consisting of abundant islands\u2014 exhibits distinct climate and convective systems due to its geographical characteristics. Different temporal resolution of Himawari-8 data between Japan region (2.5 min) and the tropics (10 min) may also result in different RDCA performance. Therefore, it is important to conduct an evaluation study before operating the RDCA in Indonesia. By performing spatial comparison and using dichotomous and probabilistic verifications with rain gauges at various thresholds, this study finds that the RDCA is able to detect and predict rainfall events in Indonesia. The best lead time is 10 min but the predictive signals extend up to 30 min in advance; it is shorter than that observed in Japan. Lighter rainfall has higher predictability compared with heavier rainfall. The predicted heavy rainfall events show good accuracy, probability of detection, and brier score. The RDCA index and rainfall intensity appear to have a good correlation, where light (heavy) rainfall is better predicted by low (high) RDCA indices. It confirms the usefulness of varying RDCA index in contrast to the classic dichotomous RDCA index. This study reveals the positive prospects of RDCA in Indonesia. We also discuss some future challenges and give possible recommendations regarding an operational RDCA system.

The operation of power plants using fossil fuels impacts emissions harmful to the environment. This paper discusses a new technique for determining the cost of reducing emissions through optimizing generators operations by considering emissions, which is often named Economic Emission Dispatch. The optimization method used is a candidate area reduction technique. This technique was tested using 500 kV, 25 buses with various loads, and the Java-Bali electrical system. The ratio between the cost and emission difference is determined in various conditions from the combination of costs and emissions weights. The results are compared with several other methods such as the Firefly algorithm, Cuckoo algorithm, and particle swarm optimization. These various methods show that the emission reduction costs are USD41.8 to USD54.5 per ton of emission. This paper provides input to the government in making policies related to flexible power plant emission control. Considering that emission is a national issue in Indonesia, one of the efforts to reduce emissions from power plants is the implementation of regulations related to emission reductions in the power plants\u2019 operation.

Pulmonary crackles of discontinuous short duration appear on inspiration, expiration, or both. To differentiate these pulmonary crackles, the medical staff usually uses a manual method, called auscultation. Various methods were developed to recognize pulmonary crackles and distinguish them from normal pulmonary sounds to be applied in digital signal processing technology. This paper demonstrates a feature extraction method to classify pulmonary crackle and normal lung sounds using Support Vector Machine (SVM) method using several kernels by performing spectrograms of the pulmonary sound to generate the frequency profile. Spectrograms with various resolutions and 3-fold cross-validation were used to divide the training data and the test data in the testing process. The resulting accuracy ranges from 81.4%-100%. More accuracy values of 100% are generated by a feature extraction in several SVM kernels using 256 points FFT with three variations of windowing parameters compared to 512 points, where the best accuracy of 100% was produced by STFT-SVM method. This method has a potential to be used in the classification of other biomedical signals. The advantages of that are that the number of features produced is the same as the N-point FFT used for any signal length, the flexibility in the STFT parameters changes, such as the type of window and the window's length.

One of the causes of the emergence of this new virus is the coinfection of two different strains. Apart from the emergence of new variants, several coinfection cases with other pathogens are reported with severe conditions. We constructed an SI1I2I3R1R2R3model to describe the coinfection of influenza and other respiratory pathogen transmissions by considering aspects of waning immunity, reinfected with the different pathogen and coinfected individuals. Analysis of this model reveals four equilibria: disease-free, two boundary endemics, and coexistence equilibria. The first three equilibria are expressed explicitly, along with the basic reproductive ratio. Stability conditions for boundary equilibria are shown analytically for the case with no coinfection and the case of symmetry. These conditions provide possible bifurcation points for numerical coexistence exploration and the nature of their stability. Numerical simulations show that no coexistence equilibrium exists in the case of no coinfection. As with coinfection, stable coexistence occurs for a relatively large coinfection rate, and Hopf bifurcations appear at two different values of infection rate of each pathogen. Stable limit cycles exist for pathogen infection rates between the two Hopf points. We also identify the periods of limit cycle increases as the infection rate of pathogen increases and decreases after reaching the maximum value. \u00a9 2021","abstrakClean":"influenza contagious pathogen caused ribonucleic acid rna virus attack respiratory tract disease still one leading cause mortality morbidity due continuous emergence new virus variant one cause emergence new virus coinfection two different strain apart emergence new variant several coinfection case pathogen reported severe condition constructed siiirrrmodel describe coinfection influenza respiratory pathogen transmission considering aspect waning immunity reinfected different pathogen coinfected individual analysis model reveals four equilibrium diseasefree two boundary endemic coexistence equilibrium first three equilibrium expressed explicitly along basic reproductive ratio stability condition boundary equilibrium shown analytically case coinfection case symmetry condition provide possible bifurcation point numerical coexistence exploration nature stability numerical simulation show coexistence equilibrium exists case coinfection coinfection stable coexistence occurs relatively large coinfection rate hopf bifurcation appear two different value infection rate pathogen stable limit cycle exist pathogen infection rate two hopf point also identify period limit cycle increase infection rate pathogen increase decrease reaching maximum value","aspects":["SDG3"]},{"Judul":"Forecasting of Wind Speed and Power through FFNN and CFNN Using HPSOBA and MHPSO-BAACs Techniques","Penulis":"Manzoor Ellahi, Muhammad Rehan Usman, Waqas Arif, Hafiz Fuad Usman, Waheed A.

However, cybersecurity researchers have not profoundly studied the practical application of government data security requirements (e.g. data confidentiality) in service level agreements (SLAs) in the context of an outsourced scenario. The relationships with external service providers are usually established through SLAs as trust-enhancing instruments. However, there is a concern that existing SLAs mainly focus on the system availability and performance aspects but overlook cybersecurity requirements (e.g. data security) in SLAs. Such an understanding is essential to develop government SLA data confidentiality requirements into the formulation of security-related SLAs. We seek to provide insights by developing and conducting a grounded adaptive Delphi method (GADM) with 35 government participants through group discussions and individual sessions. The work on the Indonesian Government's data confidentiality requirements was used as a case study. This paper provides insights into three understandings of the increasing considerations of the Government's data confidentiality requirements in SLA definitions.

Fire cases that often occur require a system that is able to detect fires and provide information to users remotely to reduce the impact of fires. Along with the development of hardware technology such as computers, the use of GIS seems to be an effective shortcut in analyzing an event. Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized application workloads, offering declarative configuration and automation. This research designs a Google Maps API System tool for forest and land fires using a real-time database on microservices infrastructure with outputs in the form of fire locations and the results of sensor readings used. Broadly speaking, the processes that occur in the design of the location of forest fire points will be detected by sensors. Then firebase will store forest fire data which will simultaneously be updated on the website. Clients can see the point of forest fires through a browser on their respective desktops. Based on the results of the performance tests that have been carried out, it can be concluded that the use of Kubernetes microclusters can provide advantages when compared to those built monolithically, because Kubernetes microclusters have several advantages, namely having the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler feature, and the Kubernetes microcluster manages components and related services well.

Payment through an electronic wallet, which is one of the solutions to digitize consumer payables and corporate receivables, is increasingly popular globally. An electronic wallet (E-Wallet) is an electronic service that stores payment data such as cards and electronic payments (e-money), which can also be used as a means of payment. In Indonesia, it gives a big impact on the consumers' daily life because of ease of use by the so-called cashless payment method. Many E-Wallet applications in Indonesia offer many advantages, easy to use and guaranteed network security, and the availability of payment methods at various outlets. In this article, there are three alternative E-Wallets taken as objects of search, namely Dana, OVO, and DOKU. These three e-wallets will be analyzed using a quantitative research method approach, which is systematic scientific research on the parts and phenomena and their relationships. The types of data used in this study are primary and secondary data. The primary data consists of numbers of a survey that has been carried out by other research by using 1500 respondents, and the secondary data is carried out by using literature research.

This can be seen from the number of taekwondo competitions held in Indonesia and the many achievements that Indonesia has in the Taekwondo sport. However, the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic impacted the sport of taekwondo, especially in the implementation of the taekwondo competition. This is because the government limits all crowding activities so that activities are ultimately carried out online. This also applies to taekwondo competitions which are finally held online. Seeing this, a device was made that can classify the types of foot kick movements expected to assist the judges in making judgments when conducting taekwondo competitions. This device can classify foot kick foot and send the classification results using a smartphone so that the results can be seen directly. In this study, we seek for an appropriate feature extraction and machine learning technique to incorporate into the device to build a device that can categorize Taekwondo kicks.

Turkey has been identified as among the countries yet to ratify their agreements with both Kyoto and Paris agreements in fight to reduce the global warming. It is essential to investigate to know if Turkey is promoting climate change as could be among the reason why it fails to work in line the agreement to reduce the global warming. The authors adopted quantile regression (QR) to study the linear relationship that exist among the selected variables in order to have a valid conclusion on the stand of the Turkey towards the control of global warming. Our findings are: A negatively significant relationship between the carbon emission and the agriculture in the all the quantiles except the 90% quantile which shows a positive relationship. Also, the ordinary least square (OLS) estimate which acts as a robust check to the quantile findings confirms a negative relationship between the carbon emission and agriculture. A positively significant relationship is established between energy use and carbon emission in all the quantiles. EU (energy use) is statistically significant for the 30, 40, 50, 70, 80 and 90% quantiles. EU is more statistically significant for the 90% quantile than lower quantiles. Again, a mixed (both positive and negative) relationship is established between foreign direct investment and carbon emission in all the quantiles which shows that FDI is impacting the Turkish environment a mixed manner. It shows that the foreign investors still engage in both clean and dirty production in Turkey. This finding gives support to both pollution halo\/haven hypothesis (PHH) in Turkey. However, a 1% point increase in GDP per capita increases the carbon emission both in the 10% quantiles and OLS by 2.82 and 2.797% respectively. This shows a positive relationship that exist between GDP per capita and the carbon emission. GDP is statistically significant for all quantiles, and show that there is a strong relationship between CO2and GDP.

Data from the Indonesian Ministry of Finance shows that purchase transactions via e-commerce increased 18.1 percent to 98.3 million, with a total transaction value of 9.9 percent to Rp20.7 trillion. Fast and efficient delivery and pick-up of goods is the core operation of courier services. The biggest challenge for courier service providers is how to compete with other companies that offer the same type of service. Service users are increasingly demanding the security and reliability of delivery services so that they can meet the expectations of service users. The expectations of service users used as targets for company achievement are (1) reliability (on time, accuracy, integrity), (2) convenience (collecting units, delivery coverage, operating hours), (3) services, and (4) cost.

This paper aims to discover knowledge related to zakat administration during the pandemic from the information in a virtual environment. Furthermore, the discussion is contextualised to the socio-economic debates. Design\/methodology\/approach: This is a qualitative study operated via text mining to discover knowledge of zakat administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Board of Zakat Republic of Indonesia (BAZNAS RI) is selected for a single case study. This paper samples BAZNAS RI\u2019s situation report on COVID-19 from its virtual website. The data consists of 40 digital pages containing 19,812 characters, 3,004 words and 3,003 white spaces. The text mining analytical steps are performed via RStudio. The following R packages, networkD3, igraph, ggraph and ggplot2 are used to run the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling. Findings: The machine learning analysis via RStudio results in the 16 topics associated with the 3 primary topics (i.e. Education, Sadaqah and Health Services). The topic modelling discovers knowledge about BAZNAS RI\u2019s assistance for COVID-19 relief, which may help the readers understand zakat administration in times of the pandemic from BAZNAS RI\u2019s virtual website. This finding may draw the theory of socio-economic zakat, which explains that zakat as a religious obligation plays a critical role in shaping a Muslim community's social and economic processes, notably during the unprecedented times of COVID-19. Research limitations\/implications: This study uses data from a single zakat institution. Thus, the generalisation of the finding is limited to the sampled institution. Practical implications: This research is both theoretically and practically important for academics and industry professionals. This paper contributes to the novelty in performing text mining via R in gaining knowledge about the recent zakat administration from a virtual website. The finding of this study (i.e. the topic modelling) is practically essential for zakat stakeholders to understand the contribution of zakat in managing the COVID-19 impacts. Social implications: This work derives a theory of \u201csocio-economic zakat\u201d that explains the importance of a zakat institution in activating zakat for managing socio-economic issues during the pandemic. Thus, paying zakat to an authorised institution may actualise more maslahah (public interest) compared to paying it directly to the asnaf (zakat beneficiaries) without any measurement Originality\/value: This study is among the pioneers in gaining knowledge from Indonesia\u2019s zakat management during the COVID-19 outbreak via text mining.

In this study, micro-sized graphite was inserted into anatase-TiO2 solar cells using the doctor blade and spin-coating methods. The morphology and the effect of graphite insertion on TiO2 to the absorption spectrum are characterized by using scanning electron microscopy and UV-Vis, respectively. Meanwhile, the efficiency of solar cell is determined from the I-V curve characterization. Generally the I-V curve characteristics is affected by the mass of graphite insertion, Even though the observed highest efficiency is 0.052 %, the graphite insertion is found to increase the light absorption about 75 % when 0.4 gram graphite is inserted to 0.7 gram TiO2 and deposited using doctor blade method. Furthermore, the I-V curve characteristics and efficiency can be modified by depositing the sample using spin coating method which tends to produce higher open circuit voltage and smaller short circuit method.

Unlike the Delta variant, the number of deaths in the Omicron type did not increase significantly and remained constant, even though the cases increased significantly. It is hoped that Indonesia will declare COVID-19 endemic. Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia and the first city where the new COVID-19 virus emerged. Therefore, we are trying to model COVID-19 cases in Jakarta and predict future cases to see if endemic conditions are identified. We applied Neural Network Auto-Regressive (NNAR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) methods. It is found that the NNAR forecast better for positive confirmed cases with an R-squared 0.939 and the LSTM forecast better for cases of death with an R-squared 0.9337. The forecasting results for the next 7 days reveal that positive confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Jakarta will increase slightly. In addition, the death cases experienced a very small increase, only one new case.

While the usage of social media has grown rapidly, it has caused numerous concerns. The literature on the motivations for women to use social media is edifying, but the results may not reveal the holistic continuum of social media usage motives among Malaysian housewives due to several distinctive and dynamic circumstances of this marginalised group. This study delves into housewives\u2019 motives for social media usage and its effects on their well-being and flourishing based on the uses and gratification theory. Five motives have been proposed, namely escapism, information seeking, friendship maintenance, relationship initiation, and nostalgia, which were then tested for well-being and flourishing. In Study 1, a total of 268 housewives in Malaysia, who are active users of social media in their daily lives were involved in the survey. Data were analysed using SPSS v.23 and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 3.1 applications. Meanwhile Study 2 was conducted by using focus group discussions with ten housewives. The findings of Study 1 revealed that motives of social media usage among housewives have a significant and positive impact on both well-being and flourishing. In contrast, Study 2 found five themes that emerged from the thematic analysis, strengthening relationships, emotional support, encouraging thoughts and characters, side income and support system, and acknowledgement of enrichment.

The government has held a COVID-19 vaccination program as an effort to deal with the COVID-19 problem since January 13, 2021. Many problems occurred due to difficulties in dividing the vaccination recipient areas. This is due to the large number of regions with different conditions for each region. One of the efforts to assist the process of processing large vaccination data is data mining techniques and using the clustering method with the K-medoids algorithm. In this study, data on COVID-19 vaccination was grouped in the East Jakarta area using the K-medoids algorithm clustering method. The calculation is carried out using the Euclidean Distance equation and the value of S > 0. The grouped area categories are at the kelurahan level which will then be divided into several clusters. The clustering process was carried out with RapidMiner on 267 kelurahan data on four main attributes, namely the number of targets, the number of vaccine doses 1, the number of vaccine doses 2, and the number of vaccine doses 3. The clustering process was carried out in 6 simulations with variations of k medoids as much as 2 to 7. The results of clustering show the best number of clusters obtained in the simulation is cluster 6 with the smallest Davies Bouldin Index (DBI) value of 0.209.

The RELM uses measured WS at heights 10-40 m to estimate WS at 50 m. The estimation results of 50 m are further used along with the measured WS at 10-40 to estimate WS at 60 m. This procedure continues until the estimation of 180 m. The RELM's performance is compared with the regression tree (RegTree) method and the standard 1\/7 Power Law. The proposed algorithm provides an economical method to find wind speed at hub height and, consequently, the potential wind energy that can be generated from turbines installed at hub height based on measurements taken at much lower heights.

Therefore, evaluating financial stability through a system-wide network approach provides more adequate knowledge than evaluating a bank as an individual. In this approach, individual banks and their transaction activities are modeled into a transaction network, forming a network topology.

This infection was initially discovered in one of the cities in the Republic of China, Wuhan, in December 2019 and since then has been spread throughout the globe as a global pandemic. To prevent the virus from spreading, positive cases must be identified early and infected persons must be treated as soon as possible. As new instances emerge regularly, many developing countries are experiencing COVID-19 testing kit scarcity because the demand for testing kits has soared. As an alternative, radiological imaging techniques such as X-ray images have been proven to help in COVID-19 diagnosis because images from X-ray provide valuable information about the COVID-19 virus disease. This paper presents a survey of Deep learning-based methods in identifying COVID-19 with X-ray input images, and classifies these images into several categories, namely: no findings, normal, COVID, and pneumonia. Several studies have been included with details about their datasets, methodologies, and findings. A total of thirteen popular datasets and fifteen articles are reviewed in this paper. Research challenges and recommendations for future research directions are also provided as an evaluation of previous research. Search for research articles in well-known digital libraries, namely Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Springer, and ScienceDirect, was carried out to obtain a list of studies relevant to the scope of research. Related articles that have a high impact are considered in the list of studies. Also, in selecting studies related to the research scope, we apply some inclusion and exclusion criteria. The list of studies used in subsequent research is imported to the library. Then, studies that did not match the criteria for inclusion were eliminated. The clinical application of artificial intelligence, i.e., DL in diagnosing COVID-19, is promising, and further research is needed. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches could be used in collaboration through X-ray pictures to identify diseases quickly and accurately, reducing the shortage of testing equipment and their restrictions.

Skin cancer diagnosis done manually by a dermatologist through a biopsy and microscopic process. However, this process takes a long time and has a risk of accidents in the biopsy process. Whereas early diagnosis shows that more than 90% can be cured, while delay in diagnosis shows less than 50% can be cured. For this reason, this research was conducted to design and implement a system that can classify skin cancer in order to facilitate the skin detection process to be faster. This study applied the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method using the Alexnet architecture to classify skin cancers into four categories, namely dermatofibromas, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma. Experiments were carried out using a dataset obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset of 4000 images of skin cancer conditions of dermatofibroma, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma, consisting of 1000 images in each class. The amount of training data used is 2700 skin cancer images. While the number of validation data used is 900 images. Then the remaining 400 images were used as test data. The experimental results using training data and validation data show that the best optimizer is Adam and the use of a learning rate of 0.001 produces an accuracy value of 99% and a loss value of 0.0596 on the applied Alexnet architecture.

It can be seen in the increase in people's consumption patterns from trading through physical stores (offline) to trading through electronic systems, often referred to as e-commerce. Logistics services are distribution actors in the downstream line which are tasked with delivering products from the fulfillment center from e-commerce to the end customer. The uncertainty of the number of requests is the biggest challenge for logistics service players. The growth of e-commerce has also led to an increase in sales volume in e-commerce which has given rise to a new generation of warehouses that are specifically tailored to the special needs of online retailers who directly serve the demands of end-customers in the business-to-consumer (B2C) segment. Traditional warehousing systems cannot handle orders with the characteristics of many transactions but smaller sizes. In addition, warehouses that handle e-commerce are also required to have a fast process in the warehouse because shipments must be made on the same day. In this study, the author aims to perform calculations to find the optimal order picking time in the warehouse, so orders in e-commerce can be processed faster by comparing the picking process time using ordinary Single Picker Routing Problem (SPRP) and combined with the concept of wave picking using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

The number of internet users in Indonesia reached 205 million in January 2022. This data means that 73.7% of Indonesia's population has used the internet. The median internet speed for mobile phones in Indonesia is 15.82 Mbps, while the median internet connection speed for Wi-Fi in Indonesia is 20.13 Mbps. As predicted by many, real-time traffic such as multimedia streaming dominates more than 79% of traffic on the internet network. This condition will be a severe challenge for the internet network, which is required to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) for user mobility, such as reducing delay, data loss, and network costs. However, IP-based networks are no longer efficient at managing traffic. Named Data Network (NDN) is a promising technology for building an agile communication model that reduces delays through a distributed and adaptive name-based data delivery approach. NDN replaces the 'where' paradigm with the concept of 'what'. User requests are no longer directed to a specific IP address but to specific content. This paradigm causes responses to content requests to be served by a specific server and can also be served by the closest device to the requested data. NDN router has CS to cache the data, significantly reducing delays and improving the internet network's quality of Service (QoS). Motivated by this, in 2019, we began intensive research to achieve a national flagship product, an NDN router with different functions from ordinary IP routers. NDN routers have cache, forwarding, and routing functions that affect data security on name-based networks. Designing scalable NDN routers is a new challenge as NDN requires fast hierarchical name-based lookups, perpackage data field state updates, and large-scale forward tables. We have a research team that has conducted NDN research through simulation, emulation, and testbed approaches using virtual machines to get the best NDN router design before building a prototype. Research results from 2019 show that the performance of NDN-based networks is better than existing IP-based networks. The tests were carried out based on various scenarios on the Indonesian network topology using NDNsimulator, MATLAB, Mininet-NDN, and testbed using virtual machines. Various network performance parameters, such as delay, throughput, packet loss, resource utilization, header overhead, packet transmission, round trip time, and cache hit ratio, showed the best results compared to IP-based networks. In addition, NDN Testbed based on open source is free, and the flexibility of creating topology has also been successfully carried out. This testbed includes all the functions needed to run an NDN network. The resource capacity on the server used for this testbed is sufficient to run a reasonably complex topology. However, bugs are still found on the testbed, and some features still need improvement. The following exploration of the NDN testbed will run with more new strategy algorithms and add Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the NDN function. Using AI in cache and forwarding strategies can make the system more intelligent and precise in making decisions according to network conditions. It will be a step toward developing NDN router products by the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) Indonesia.  \u00a9 2022 IEEE.","abstrakClean":"global traffic data proliferating including indonesia number internet user indonesia reached million january data mean indonesia population used internet median internet speed mobile phone indonesia mbps median internet connection speed wifi indonesia mbps predicted many realtime traffic multimedia streaming dominates traffic internet network condition severe challenge internet network required improve quality experience qoe user mobility reducing delay data loss network cost however ipbased network longer efficient managing traffic named data network ndn promising technology building agile communication model reduces delay distributed adaptive namebased data delivery approach ndn replaces paradigm concept user request longer directed specific ip address specific content paradigm cause response content request served specific server also served closest device requested data ndn router c cache data significantly reducing delay improving internet network quality service qos motivated began intensive research achieve national flagship product ndn router different function ordinary ip router ndn router cache forwarding routing function affect data security namebased network designing scalable ndn router new challenge ndn requires fast hierarchical namebased lookup perpackage data field state update largescale forward table research team conducted ndn research simulation emulation testbed approach using virtual machine get best ndn router design building prototype research result show performance ndnbased network better existing ipbased network test carried based various scenario indonesian network topology using ndnsimulator matlab mininetndn testbed using virtual machine various network performance parameter delay throughput packet loss resource utilization header overhead packet transmission round trip time cache hit ratio showed best result compared ipbased network addition ndn testbed based open source free flexibility creating topology also successfully carried testbed includes function needed run ndn network resource capacity server used testbed sufficient run reasonably complex topology however bug still found testbed feature still need improvement following exploration ndn testbed run new strategy algorithm add artificial intelligence ai ndn function using ai cache forwarding strategy make system intelligent precise making decision according network condition step toward developing ndn router product bandung institute technology itb indonesia ieee","aspects":["SDG1","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Integrating Blockchain for Health Insurance in Indonesia with Hash Authentication","Penulis":"Erwin Sutanto, Rahmat Mulyana, Franky Chandra Satria Arisgraha, Guillermo Escriv\u00e1-Escriv\u00e1, ","Tahun":2022,"Abstrak":"The use of blockchain has received great attention in its adoption as a financial instrument in cryptocurrencies.

The specific challenges in developing detect defectors involve the vagueness and tiny size of defects. To solve these problems, we propose incorporating super\u2010resolution technique, sequential feature pyramid network, and boundary localization. Initially, the ensemble of enhanced super\u2010resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN) was proposed for the preprocessing stage to generate a more detailed contour of the original steel image. Next, in the detector section, the latest state\u2010of-the\u2010art feature pyramid network, known as De\u2010tectoRS, utilized the recursive feature pyramid network technique to extract deeper multi\u2010scale steel features by learning the feedback from the sequential feature pyramid network.

Wave forecasting is very necessary to support daily marine activities such as marine transportation scheduling and daily operation offshore or in the harbor, so that these activities can be carried out with careful planning and can minimize the risk of accidents. Significant wave height (SWH) and peak wave period (Tp) predictions are essential to wave forecasting. In this research, we perform a time series wave forecasting for SWH and Tp using a relatively recent deep learning model, i.e., Transformer. As a case study, we choose a location in the southern part of Java island, Indonesia, i.e., on the Cilacap coast. We also compare the Transformer results with the well-known LSTM model. Transformer is used because it has an architecture based on encoder and decoder methods which allows this model to learn data better and also train the model faster in terms of performance. Meanwhile, LSTM is used because it's ability to remember long backward historical data. The result shows that the Transformer model performs better in terms of correlation coefficient and root mean squared error than the LSTM model for Hs. At the same time, LSTM came as a better model for Tp than the Transformer.  \u00a9 2023 IEEE.","abstrakClean":"wave phenomenon ocean fluctuate like weather parameter making forecasting challenging carrying activity sea wave forecasting necessary support daily marine activity marine transportation scheduling daily operation offshore harbor activity carried careful planning minimize risk accident significant wave height swh peak wave period tp prediction essential wave forecasting research perform time series wave forecasting swh tp using relatively recent deep learning model ie transformer case study choose location southern part java island indonesia ie cilacap coast also compare transformer result wellknown lstm model transformer used architecture based encoder decoder method allows model learn data better also train model faster term performance meanwhile lstm used ability remember long backward historical data result show transformer model performs better term correlation coefficient root mean squared error lstm model h time lstm came better model tp transformer ieee","aspects":["SDG1","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Analysis of the Effect of Dimensional Variation and Number of Air Inlets on the Efficiency of Gasification Stoves using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) Simulation","Penulis":"Rachmad Rezki, Suwandi, Amaliyah Rohsari Indah Utami, ","Tahun":2023,"Abstrak":"Nowadays, the consumption of non-renewable energy is high. As a result, the availability of this energy is decreasing. Because of this, other energy alternatives are needed. One example of another option is the use of biomass. An example of using biomass is the gasification process. This process was carried out in a device called a gasification stove, namely a gasifier. A gasifier has been developed to produce an optimal combustion system. The constraints in this development are costs for manufacture and the potential for failure. Therefore, simulations using Ansys Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software student versions were carried out to reduce the costs for manufacture and the potential for failure of the gasifier. The simulation contains dimensional variations and the number of air inlets of gasifier of downdraft gasifier, updraft gasifier, and entrained flow gasifier. Further, the influence of the dimensions and quantity of inlet that affect each design's efficiency and the temperature was examined. The simulation results show that the best dimensions for the downdraft gasifier, updraft gasifier, and entrained flow gasifier are height and diameter of 50cm; 14.5cm (A1), 144cm; 70cm (C1), and 900cm; 300cm (B3), respectively. The best number of air inlets of A1, C1, and B3 gasifiers is 6, 1, and 6, respectively. Thus, the efficiency of each gasifier A1, C1, and B3 are 11.393%, 9.354%, and 50.885%, respectively. Furthermore, the A1, C1, and B3 gasifiers temperatures were 1055.25 K, 1383.44 K, and 3580.15 K, respectively.

Well-known risk factors include hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, along with exposure to aflatoxins, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Genomic variants play a crucial role in mediating the associations between these risk factors and liver cancer. However, the specific variants involved in this process remain under-explored. This study utilized a bioinformatics approach to identify genetic variants associated with liver cancer from various continents. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with liver cancer were retrieved from the genome-wide association studies catalog. Prioritization was then performed using functional annotation with HaploReg v4.1 and the Ensembl database. The prevalence and allele frequencies of each variant were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Two variants, rs2294915 and rs2896019, encoded by the PNPLA3 gene, were found to be highly expressed in the liver tissue, as well as in the skin, cell-cultured fibroblasts, and adipose-subcutaneous tissue, all of which contribute to the risk of liver cancer. We further found that these two SNPs (rs2294915 and rs2896019) were positively correlated with the prevalence rate. Positive associations with the prevalence rate were more frequent in East Asian and African populations. We highlight the utility of this population-specific PNPLA3 genetic variant for genetic association studies and for the early prognosis and treatment of liver cancer. This study highlights the potential of integrating genomic databases with bioinformatic analysis to identify genetic variations involved in the pathogenesis of liver cancer. The genetic variants investigated in this study are likely to predispose to liver cancer and could affect its progression and aggressiveness.

A heart attack occurs when blood flow to the heart stops completely, causing damage to the heart muscles due to lack of oxygen supply to the heart muscles. Phonocardiogram (PCG) is one type of signal that is commonly used to detect cardiovascular disease. There have been many studies related to cardiovascular disease detection based on PCG signals.

Generally, MI detection procedures must go through various laboratory tests which are quite long while patients need fast and accurate treatment. To overcome this problem, in this study, a model was built to detect MI.

Prediction of the use of electricity load is crucial for increasing electricity production efficiency, especially for electricity companies. One way of approaching electrical load prediction is with a machine learning model. This study modeled short-term time series forecasting of electricity load using the CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model with an attention mechanism to calculate short-term predictions, namely 1, 3, and 7 days ahead. The study aims to see the effects of additional attention mechanisms in the hybrid model CNN-BiLTSM with the resulting accuracy that the model gets. Furthermore, we also compare the CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model with attention to the BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM models. As a case study, this study used data on the electricity load in Bali, Indonesia. We also compare the experimental results to show that the CNN-BiLSTM with Attention model produces the best accuracy, with a root mean square error of 13.676 and a correlation coefficient 0.993 compared to the other two. These experiments have shown that improving predictions of electricity usage can be achieved by combining the original BiLSTM model with both a CNN layer and an attention mechanism.

A recommender system for cars has been developed but only based on technical specifications. However, cars have complex specifications, so many users do not familiar with the technical specification. Users find it easier to express their needs in terms of the functional aspects of a product rather than its technical features. To address this issue, we propose a conversational recommender system (CRS) to assist in interacting with users in order to elicit user need preferences. Therefore, we created a conversational recommendation system (CRS) designed to interact with users and capture their specific preferences. CRS engages users in conversations like sales professionals, facilitating natural and efficient interactions to uncover their specific desires. The model combines ontology structures and algorithms to effectively capture user preferences, taking into account explicit product information and temporal data to build domains and user profiles. The evaluation of this system focuses on two main parameters: system performance and user satisfaction. The system performance evaluation yielded an impressive overall accuracy rate of 87.84%, accompanied by positive feedback from users regarding satisfaction.

The previous studies only implemented logistic regression, sensitive to the imbalanced dataset. Meanwhile, other countries implemented survival analysis to overcome the problem. Most survival analyses using Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model require the variables to be time-independent. To this end, this study aims to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in Indonesia using a survival analysis approach using Jakarta as a case study. We use the Piecewise Exponential Model (PEM) to overcome the time-dependent problem in CPH. The findings show that the COVID-19 mortality does not differ the gender. In contrast, it differs the elderly with 3.5 times higher to be deceased. Dyspnea, malaise, and pneumonia are the primary symptoms associated with COVID-19 mortality. From the comorbidities, diabetes and chronic disease are related to COVID-19, while hypertension and heart attack are still considerable in clustered contexts. The advanced treatment using intubation and extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) produces a relatively large hazard risk of COVID-19 mortality.

Therefore, measuring whether a company is distressed or non-distressed can be done by looking at the ratios derived from the components of the financial statements from both the balance sheet and the company's profit and loss. This study offers a new method for measuring financial distress in companies with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model provided comes from several financial ratios in 17 construction companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The model is expected to produce the best model by showing the lowest prediction error rate. The results showed that the best ANN model has 25 inputs, 20 hidden layer neurons, and 1 best model output. The model obtained will be tested directly on the sample used; the results are that 6 construction companies in Indonesia have financial distress and 11 non-distress problems. This result proves that the best model obtained can predict the level of financial distress of companies with a small error rate to produce 6 companies identified as financially distressed. This result can be a warning for companies to increase revenue by adding new projects to get out of financial distress status.

Traditional methodologies for identifying and inspecting distribution issues rely heavily on manual, analog procedures. This study seeks to harness the Internet of Things (IoT) for the development of an enhanced water distribution monitoring system. Employing a quantitative experimental methodology, the proposed system integrates an Arduino Uno microcontroller with sensors for water pressure, flow, and GPS location. Data captured by these sensors is synchronized with the Thinger.io platform via an ESP-32 module, facilitating real-time monitoring. Upon evaluation, it was observed that IoT implementation via Thinger.io could effectively track fluctuations in water discharge and pressure. Recorded data revealed a maximum water discharge of 303 liters, with water pressure values ranging from a low of 0.30 bar to a high of 4.07 bar. The outcome of this research is a visual monitoring framework that provides a dynamic assessment of water discharge and pressure, enabling water service providers to conduct routine evaluations with enhanced precision.

According to the previous study, automatic text summarization in Bahasa Indonesia is still challenging due to research in this area, especially the research which discusses TextRank algorithm performance, which is still meagerly. Accordingly, this research observes the performance of the TextRank algorithm to summarize the text in Bahasa Indonesia. The TextRank algorithm summarizes a text by sorting out the essential words and relevant sentences regardless of the source language. This algorithm uses a vertex to represent a word. The similarity measurement process will calculate the overlapping words (the same word between two vertices). These overlapping words are represented by the edge, which connects the vertices. Thus, the text forms a graph. This research focuses on the similarity measurement process to determine relevant sentences in a text. As the similarity measurement is critical for the summarization result, this research switches the original process to the Levenshtein Distance algorithm and observes its performance. This research uses the human-produced summarized text by the expert in Bahasa Indonesia linguistics to evaluate the result. The evaluation method is conducted by using ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2. The result shows that the average of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 for the TextRank algorithm is 0.439 and 0.3186, respectively. Meanwhile, the modified TextRank obtains 0.3999 and 0.2805, respectively.

Abnormalities in the heart can usually be detected when there is an additional sound during an incomplete valve opening. Additional sounds in cardiac abnormalities can be called murmurs. Normal and murmur heart sound happen in different frequency. Therefore, frequency-based feature extraction can be used to classify heart sound. One of frequency domains is power spectrum that can be calculated for power by two frequency of signal, and it can clearly show the pattern of murmur and normal heart sound. In this research, the proposed feature extraction based on the power spectrum feature is used to become another option feature extraction for heart sound classification, which is different from previous heart sound classification studies. There are five types of feature extraction that developed base power spectrum, which are Mean Frequency, Total Power, Maximum Peak Frequency, 1st Spectral Moment, and 2nd Spectral moment. Several classifiers also are used to get the best classier base that features. The best selection feature of this research is Mean Frequency, with best classifier are Stochastic Gradient Descent and logistic regression and accuracy 93%. When all features are used for classifier, almost all of the models have the highest accuracy especially when classifier with mean frequency, 1st Spectral, and 2nd Spectral moment has good accuracy too. Using all features, the best classifier for heart sound case is Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes with accuracy reaching 100%.

To find the parameter's optimum values, the Desirability Function approach (DFA), Swarm Salp single objective, Multi Objective Bat algorithm (MOBA), Response surface methodology (RSM) and D-optimal design approach were employed. Advanced machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to anticipate these characteristics. It was found that B20G5 had a better brake thermal efficiency (BTE), when compared to the other samples (and around 11% higher than diesel fuel at full load). The emissions of Carbon monoxide (CO) and Hydrocarbon (HC) were lower for B20G5 blended fuel than for diesel (Around 23.52% lower than diesel).

Two extreme precipitation (EP) events led to major flooding on 23\u201325 March 2021 and produced a rain-hail mixture (RHM) on 11 April 2021 in the Greater Bandung (GB) basin area, Indonesia. We investigated the spatial and vertical structure of precipitating cloud systems and the plausible mechanism triggering the two case studies with combined multiple remote sensing observations using an X-band polarimetric Doppler Weather Radar (Xpol) and X-band rain scanner radar (RSR) network, supported by rain gauges and satellite observation. The local processes controlling the intense rainfall events over the complex topography were quantified for the first time using an observational campaign in Indonesia. During the first EP event (23\u201325 March 2021), the modified satellite algorithm successively confirmed that the mesoscale convective system triggered the local anomalous circulation. The RSR network reveals that the EP in eastern GB contributed to the overflow of the Citarum River alongside the basin, coinciding with the eastward propagating convective system that produced oblate-shaped water droplets without hail. Nevertheless, during the second EP event on 11 April 2021, the strengthening of mountain-based convection played a main role in producing RHM, confirmed by a hail differential reflectivity larger than 12 dB and exhibited hail early stage over two height levels in different locations (981 m and 1033 m) in the GB. Our study also found Doppler vorticity-based and rain sizes combination indicators using RSR data networks in capturing such extreme weather events over complex topography with 35 min early times to support the early warning system of hydrometeorological disaster mitigation over GB, Indonesia. \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.","abstrakClean":"intense precipitation event main cause triggering hydrometeorological hazard complex terrain two extreme precipitation ep event led major flooding march produced rainhail mixture rhm april greater bandung gb basin area indonesia investigated spatial vertical structure precipitating cloud system plausible mechanism triggering two case study combined multiple remote sensing observation using xband polarimetric doppler weather radar xpol xband rain scanner radar rsr network supported rain gauge satellite observation local process controlling intense rainfall event complex topography quantified first time using observational campaign indonesia first ep event march modified satellite algorithm successively confirmed mesoscale convective system triggered local anomalous circulation rsr network reveals ep eastern gb contributed overflow citarum river alongside basin coinciding eastward propagating convective system produced oblateshaped water droplet without hail nevertheless second ep event april strengthening mountainbased convection played main role producing rhm confirmed hail differential reflectivity larger db exhibited hail early stage two height level different location gb study also found doppler vorticitybased rain size combination indicator using rsr data network capturing extreme weather event complex topography min early time support early warning system hydrometeorological disaster mitigation gb indonesia elsevier bv","aspects":["SDG1","SDG11","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Fintech Adoption among Indonesian Generation Z: A Technology Acceptance Model Perspective","Penulis":"Muhammad Irfan Arifin, Muhardi Saputra, Warih Puspitasari, Jacques Bazen, ","Tahun":2023,"Abstrak":"Fintech is a financial service that is currently being developed in Indonesia.

Therefore, providing data that can track and evaluate learners' interactions in e-learning platforms is crucial. This research aims to find relevant data for BI analysis applied to e-learning in higher education from various stakeholder perspectives. The second objective is to visualize student activity data in lectures while using e-learning for study programs that apply asynchronous learning models. Learner activity data in this research will be displayed in the form of a dashboard whose results can be monitored by various stakeholders.

In order to create effective educational methods as institutions prepare for the post-pandemic period, it is essential to understand students' preferences for various learning modes. With the aid of machine learning techniques, this study seeks to forecast preferences for learning styles in post-pandemic higher education. The study made use of a dataset compiled from a wide range of college students, which included information on the institution type (public or private), program type (bachelor's or diploma), academic discipline (science or humanities), gender, year of study, internet use, communication costs, comorbidity status, vaccination history, gadget and laptop ownership, and preferred learning mode (online, in-person, or both). For the aim of prediction, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used. Its kernel functions included linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. Performance criteria like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to assess the models after the dataset was randomly partitioned into training and testing sets. The findings showed that for identifying the preferred mode of learning, SVM with the RBF kernel had the highest prediction accuracy (91.67%). Further proving the RBF kernel's efficacy, the confusion matrix analysis showed that high values in the diagonal represented accurate predictions for each of the three classes (both online and onsite). The results imply that machine learning approaches, in particular SVM with the RBF kernel, may accurately forecast students' preferences for learning modes in the post-pandemic situation.

The power sector is switching to alternative energy sources, including renewable energy resources (RES) such as Photovoltaic (PV) and wind power (WP) and battery energy storage systems (BESS), among others, due to an increase in the use of fossil fuels and their shortage. Since the power generation of these resources is uncertain due to climatic fluctuations and the direct integration of these resources into the power grid is very complex due to the issues such as; voltage and frequency regulation, overloading of active transmission lines, and supply-demand disparity, the research on system uncertainties is receiving increasing attention. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the several parameters of uncertainty, approaches for dealing with the uncertainty in battery energy storage (BES)-based RES integrated grid, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Moreover, various analytical and numerical approaches were developed for integrating RES and BESS into the power grid, including probabilistic methods, possibilistic methods, robust optimization-based techniques, and machine learning algorithms. The comparative analysis of these approaches highlights their relative strengths and weaknesses, providing a valuable resource for researchers and utility planners. Additionally, this review paper identifies several issues and challenges associated with the integration of RES and BESS into the power grid, such as power quality, economical effect, battery aging effect, and environmental effect. Furthermore, the paper suggests a few future research directions, including the development of novel models for analyzing uncertainty in power systems, coordination of uncertainty parameters, integration of BESS into RES and grid, power electronics integration, and environmental factor. Overall, this article's novel contributions include a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty parameters, a comparative analysis of uncertainty modeling approaches, an identification of critical issues and challenges, and the suggestion of future research directions to promote a sustainable and reliable power system.

At worst, dementia is often called a major neurocognitive disorder or senile disease. One of the most common types of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s is vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is closely related to cerebrovascular disease, one of which is stroke. Post-stroke patients with recurrent onset have the potential to develop dementia. An accurate diagnosis is needed for proper therapy management to ensure the patient\u2019s quality of life and prevent it from worsening. The gold standard diagnostic of vascular dementia is complex, includes psychological tests, complete memory tests, and is evidenced by medical imaging of brain lesions. However, brain imaging methods such as CT-Scan, PET-Scan, and MRI have high costs and cannot be routinely used in a short period. For more than two decades, electroencephalogram signal analysis has been an alternative in assisting the diagnosis of brain diseases associated with cognitive decline. Traditional EEG analysis performs visual observations of signals, including rhythm, power, and spikes. Of course, it requires a clinician expert, time consumption, and high costs. Therefore, a quantitative EEG method for identifying vascular dementia in post-stroke patients is discussed in this study. This study used 19 EEG channels recorded from normal elderly, post-stroke with mild cognitive impairment, and post-stroke with dementia.

Besides, the PPKM must also pay attention to some specific factors related to the real conditions of a region, such as the data on the epidemiology of COVID-19, economic situations, and population mobility. These three are called Multi Factors. Then, based on the data, COVID-19 has a specific spreading period that cannot be repeated and thus is called temporal. Therefore, using the Multi-Temporal Factors approach to identify their correlation with the PPKM policy by applying Machine Learning, such as the Multiple Linear Regression model and Dynamic Factors, is essential. This research aims to analyze the characteristics and correlations of the COVID-19 pandemic data and the effectiveness of the government's policy on community activities (PPKM) based on the data quality. The results show that the accuracy of the multiple linear regression models is 84%.

Traffic flow can specify its condition, whether it is a free flow or very heavy traffic. Traffic condition is the most important criterion used to find the best route from an origin to a destination.

Both methods deliver the saturation degree and calculate the traffic condition for each road segment. Based on the experiments, the average error rate obtained by counting the number of vehicles on Pramuka\u2013Cihapit and Trunojoyo was 0\u20132 cars, 2\u20133 motorcycles, and 0\u20131 for others.

Meanwhile, on the right side, the differences between actual and calculated vehicle speeds are between 11.088 and 22.222 km\/h. This high error rate is caused by (1) the low resolution of the public CCTV, (2) some obstacles interfering with the view of CCTV, (3) the misdetection of the type of vehicles, and by (4) the vehicles moving too fast.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with memory has produced more accurate results in predicting time series problems. Convolutional neural networks have also shown good results in terms of solving prediction problems. However, CNN models do not have the capability of remembering temporal information. This research proposes hybrid models of CNN and RNN techniques to predict MI. Specifically, CNN-LSTM and CNN-BILSTM models have been developed. The PTB XL dataset is used to train the models. The models predict ECG input as representing MI symptoms, healthy heart conditions or other cardiovascular diseases. Deep learning models offer automatic feature extraction, and our models take advantage of automatic feature extraction. The other superior models used their own feature extraction algorithm. This research proposed a straightforward architecture that depends mostly on the capability of the deep learning model to learn the data. Performance evaluation of the models shows overall accuracy of 89% for CNN LSTM and 91% for the CNN BILSTM model. \u00a9 2023 by the authors.","abstrakClean":"myocardial infarction mi death heart muscle caused lack oxygenated blood flow heart muscle main cause death worldwide fastest way detect mi using electrocardiogram ecg device generates graph heartbeat morphology certain period time patient mi need fast intervention delay lead worsening heart condition failure improve mi diagnosis much research carried come fast reliable system aid automatic mi detection prediction ecg reading recurrent neural network rnn memory produced accurate result predicting time series problem convolutional neural network also shown good result term solving prediction problem however cnn model capability remembering temporal information research proposes hybrid model cnn rnn technique predict mi specifically cnnlstm cnnbilstm model developed ptb xl dataset used train model model predict ecg input representing mi symptom healthy heart condition cardiovascular disease deep learning model offer automatic feature extraction model take advantage automatic feature extraction superior model used feature extraction algorithm research proposed straightforward architecture depends mostly capability deep learning model learn data performance evaluation model show overall accuracy cnn lstm cnn bilstm model author","aspects":["SDG3"]},{"Judul":"Vertical Wind Profile Estimation Using Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory","Penulis":"Ali Al-Shaikhi, Hilal H.

In general, WS estimation at different heights requires the site-dependent parameters such as wind shear coefficient, atmospheric conditions, and roughness length. This paper examines the use of the Convolutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BLSTM) to estimate WS at different heights based on measurements at lower heights. To perform vertical extrapolation, the CNN-BLSTM uses measured WS at 10\u201340\u00a0m heights to predict WS at 50\u00a0m. The predicted WS at 50\u00a0m are further used along with the measured WS at 10\u201340 to extrapolate WS at 60\u00a0m. This procedure is repeated until the extrapolation of WS at 180\u00a0m is achieved. The performance of the CNN-BLSTM is compared with the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine for regression (SVM), and the standard wind shear exponent (WSE)-based estimation. The extrapolated values obtained using these methods are compared with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) reference system-based measurements.

This condition occurs due to the blockage of blood vessels around the heart, inhibiting blood flow and causing an insufficient oxygen supply to the body. Typically, cardiovascular disease tests involve electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. In recent years, researchers have explored the application of Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals for cardiovascular detection due to their non-invasive, efficient, accessible, and cost-effective nature. While deep learning has been successful in object detection in digital images, its application to PCG signals for heart attack detection is rare. This study bridges this gap by introducing an enhanced technique called the Myocardial Infarction Detection System (MIDs). In contrast to previous deep learning research, this study employs a transfer learning algorithm as a classifier for MI feature datasets. Feature extraction is performed in segments to obtain more accurate MI features. Six feature extraction methods and transfer learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using the VGG-16 architecture were selected as the primary components for MI identification. Additionally, this study compares these models with other CNN transfer learning models, such as VGG-19 and Xception, to assess their performance. Two experimental scenarios were conducted to evaluate MIDs performance in MI detection: experiments without hyperparameter tuning and with hyperparameter tuning. The results indicate that MIDs with CNN (VGG-16) after tuning exhibited the highest detection performance compared to other transfer learning CNN models, both with and without tuning. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of MIDS detection with this configuration were 96.7%, 96.0%, and 97.4%, respectively.

Analysis of 29,085 datasets demonstrated that the combined implementation of Hybrid Deep Learning and FastText-enhanced feature expansion achieved the highest accuracy, with CNN-BiLSTM and BiLSTM-CNN scoring 80.55% and 80.35% respectively. These findings validate the significant accuracy boost provided by FastText when integrated with Hybrid Deep Learning. It is anticipated that the outcomes of this study will facilitate the accurate identification and removal of cyberbullying tweets, thereby contributing to a safer digital communication environment on Twitter. \u00a9 2023 Lavoisier.

There is a chance that the supporting data is either incomplete or missing, which is a common flaw that influences the prediction system\u2019s results and renders it ineffective. This paper will compare the kNN-based imputation method with the mean imputation to handle missing data, which causes the provincial vulnerability index in Indonesia to be measured incorrectly.

The most common types of cancer with high mortality are lung and colon cancer. One of the efforts to reduce cases of death is early diagnosis followed by medical therapy. Tissue sampling and clinical pathological examination are the gold standard in cancer diagnosis. However, in some cases, pathological examination of tissue to the cell level requires high accuracy, depending on the contrast of the pathological image, and the experience of the clinician. Therefore, we need an image processing approach combined with artificial intelligence for automatic classification. In this study, a method is proposed for automatic classification of lung and colon cancer based on a deep learning approach. The object of the image that is classified is the histopathological image of normal tissue, benign cancer, and malignant cancer. Convolutional neural network (CNN) with VGG16 architecture and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) were employed for demonstration of classification on 25000 histopathological images. The simulation results show that the proposed method is able to classify with a maximum accuracy of 98.96%. The system performance using CLAHE shows a higher detection accuracy than without using CLAHE and is consistent for all epoch scenarios. The comparative study shows that the proposed method outperforms some previous studies. With this proposed method, it is hoped that it can help clinicians in diagnosing cancer automatically, with low cost, high accuracy, and fast processing on large datasets. \u00a9 The Author(s).

Continuing advances in echocardiography have extended imaging capabilities into the 3D domain, subsequently overcoming the geometric assumptions associated with conventional 2D acquisitions. Nevertheless, the analysis of 3D echocardiography (3DE) poses several challenges associated with limited spatial resolution, poor contrast-to-noise ratio, complex noise characteristics, and image anisotropy. To develop automated methods for 3DE analysis, a sufficiently large, labeled dataset is typically required. However, ground truth segmentations have historically been difficult to obtain due to the high inter-observer variability associated with manual analysis. We address this lack of expert consensus by registering labels derived from higher-resolution subject-specific cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, producing 536 annotated 3DE images from 143 human subjects (10 of which were excluded). This heterogeneous population consists of healthy controls and patients with cardiac disease, across a range of demographics. To demonstrate the utility of such a dataset, a state-of-the-art, self-configuring deep learning network for semantic segmentation was employed for automated 3DE analysis. Using the proposed dataset for training, the network produced measurement biases of \u22129 \u00b1 16 ml, \u22121 \u00b1 10 ml, \u22122 \u00b1 5 %, and 5 \u00b1 23 g, for end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, and mass, respectively, outperforming an expert human observer in terms of accuracy as well as scan-rescan reproducibility. As part of the Cardiac Atlas Project, we present here a large, publicly available 3DE dataset with ground truth labels that leverage the higher resolution and contrast of CMR, to provide a new benchmark for automated 3DE analysis. Such an approach not only reduces the effect of observer-specific bias present in manual 3DE annotations, but also enables the development of analysis techniques which exhibit better agreement with CMR compared to conventional methods. This represents an important step for enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic and prognostic information to be obtained from echocardiography.

Our study demonstrates that successful ICT-enabled national development is not contingent on pursuing one strategy or the other but on how micro-level actors interpret, and subsequently respond to, these strategies and the local changes they trigger. Our findings indicate that centralisation and decentralisation are complementary rather than competing strategies to ICT-enabled national development because, if integrated into a hybrid strategy, decentralisation enables local communities to achieve national development outcomes commonly attributed to centralisation. As such, our work provides empirical evidence, explanations and new theoretical insight into the wider \u2018centralisation versus decentralisation\u2019 debate, while also outlining avenues for future research and guidelines for policymakers. \u00a9 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","abstrakClean":"centralised decentralised strategy suitable address developing nation socioeconomic challenge information communication technology ict respond longstanding question conceptualising ictenabled national development multilevel social process drawing empirical finding natural experiment set context health information system project indonesia study demonstrates successful ictenabled national development contingent pursuing one strategy microlevel actor interpret subsequently respond strategy local change trigger finding indicate centralisation decentralisation complementary rather competing strategy ictenabled national development integrated hybrid strategy decentralisation enables local community achieve national development outcome commonly attributed centralisation work provides empirical evidence explanation new theoretical insight wider centralisation versus decentralisation debate also outlining avenue future research guideline policymakers john wiley son ltd","aspects":["SDG1","SDG9","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Reference Architecture for On-Farm Palm Oil Agriculture: Risk Management in the Digital Tranformation Process","Penulis":"Alif Shofa Danutirta, Basuki Rahmad, Muharman Lubis, Jacques Bazen, ","Tahun":2023,"Abstrak":"The use of information technology in industry has become a fundamental need to win the competition, and therefore, the fulfillment of the need for information systems for all organizations which causes the development of information systems to be very fast.

Air pollution is one type of problem that is triggered by air pollutant substances. In many cases, air pollution can cause several diseases that impact long-Term health. Substances that can cause air pollution include Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (03), Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5), and Particulate Matter 10 (PM10). In recent years, many methods have been proposed to detect air pollution but still use classical machine learning as the classification method. However, the accuracy does not increase when using classical machine learning, therefore this research uses an ensemble learning algorithm as a classifier because this method combines multiple classifier. The accuracy value obtained from the entire detection process is strongly influenced by the results at the classification stage. Therefore the authors propose the use of a classification algorithm that supports increased accuracy of air pollution detection. The proposed classification method with ensemble learning increases the accuracy. The experiment results show that the lowest f1-score is good class when detected using the default AdaBoost algorithm. The f1-score is 0%. After implementing hyperparameter tuning, there is an increase in the good class, ie.: 95%. The best class after hyperparameter tuning on the AdaBoost algorithm is a hazardous class with an f1-score of 100%. The accuracy value when using the AdaBoost algorithm by default is 62%.

This study aimed to compare the roles of GLS and CA-125 in distinguishing between benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The research was conducted as a comparative study, enrolling 156 patients with ovarian tumors. Preoperative serum CA-125 and GLS levels were analyzed to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The results revealed that the mean levels of CA-125 and GLS were significantly higher in malignant ovarian tumors compared with benign ones (389.54 \u00b1 494.320 vs. 193.15 \u00b1 529.932 (U\/mL) and 17.37 \u00b1 12.156 vs. 7.48 \u00b1 4.095 (\u03bcg\/mL), respectively). The CA-125 and GLS cutoff points of 108.2 U\/mL and 18.32 \u03bcg\/mL, respectively, were associated with malignant ovarian tumors. Multivariate analyses showed that GLS had higher predictive capabilities compared with CA-125 (odds ratio 9.4 vs. 2.1). The accuracy of using GLS combined with CA-125 was higher than using CA-125 alone (73.1% vs. 68.8%). In conclusion, higher levels of CA-125 and GLS are associated with malignant ovarian tumors.

The aim of this study is to see how FDI and innovation influence the ICT goods imports in ASEAN 6. The analytical method used in this study is the Generalized Method of Moment panel data analysis of ASEAN's 6 countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, for 21 years from 2000 to 2020. Based on the results of the System GMM regression estimation, it was found that FDI had a positive and significant impact on ICT goods imports in most of the models. In comparison, innovation has a negative but not significant impact on ICT goods imports. Foreign investment has the potential to encourage imports of ICT products. In the short term, ICT goods imports are a necessity due to the absence of substitute products that have the same specifications and quality as imported products. In some cases, innovations may be in their infancy or not mature enough to significantly influence import patterns. Therefore, the government needs to consider long-term programs related to the development of industries capable of producing ICT goods.

Nuha, Ali Al Shaikhi, Satria Akbar, Mohamed Mohandes, ","Tahun":2023,"Abstrak":"An accurate vertical wind speed (WS) data estimation is required to determine the potential for wind farm installation. In general, the vertical extrapolation of WS at different heights must consider different parameters from different locations, such as wind shear coefficient, roughness length, and atmospheric conditions. The novelty presented in this article is the introduction of two steps optimization for the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model to estimate WS at different heights using measurements from lower heights. The first optimization of the RNN is performed to minimize a differentiable cost function, namely, mean squared error (MSE), using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Secondly, the RNN is optimized to reduce a non-differentiable cost function using simulated annealing (RNN-SA), namely mean absolute error (MAE). Estimation of WS vertically at 50 m height is done by training RNN-SA with the actual WS data a 10\u201340 m heights. The estimated WS at height of 50 m and the measured WS at 10\u201340 heights are further used to train RNN-SA to obtain WS at 60 m height. This procedure is repeated continuously until the WS is estimated at a height of 180 m. The RNN-SA performance is compared with the standard RNN, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and state of the art methods like convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extrapolate the WS vertically. The estimated values are also compared with real WS dataset acquired using LiDAR and tested using four error metrics namely, mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean bias error (MBE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The numerical experimental results show that the MSE values between the estimated and actual WS at 180 m height for the RNN-SA, RNN, MLP, and SVM methods are found to be 2.09, 2.12, 2.37, and 2.63, respectively. \u00a9 2023, Tech Science Press.

One of the most common methods for detecting AFIB is through the use of electrocardiography (ECG) signals. Physicians use ECG records to detect AFIB by analyzing the electrical activity of the heart. However, the symptoms may not always be present, so it is possible for a physician to misdiagnose the condition. To make sure that AFIB are detected in a timely manner and prevent potential life-Threatening incidents, the patients must undergo continuous monitoring. However, it is difficult to develop a readily available and inexpensive method for detecting AFIB using ECG signals due to the technical challenges and cost associated with procuring ECG signals. To overcome this problem, we explored the use of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals acquired from smartphone camera to detect AFIB using ECG based ensemble learning model. ECG dataset are used due to the abundance of publicly available datasets, and the strong correlation between ECG and PPG in the RR Interval and Peak-To-peak Interval, respectively.

However, there are still elderly people who take medication irregularly because their memory is starting to weaken. Early signs experienced by the elderly who suffer from memory skills are forgetting about information that has just been obtained or learned and often having difficulty completing daily work routines, so it is necessary to develop a research on products that help the elderly in carrying out regular drug-taking activities without need help from people to remind them. In this research, the design thinking method was used, namely identifying the wants and needs of 20 elderly people while taking medication and identifying them according to the first stage of design thinking empathy, through interviews and direct observation at the Guido Valadares Hospital in Timor-Leste. After the first stage, the author enters the second stage, which is define to describe the user's view which will be the basis of the product to be made. With the first and second stages already, the author will enter the third stage, namely ideate to describe the required solution. This study aims to describe each stage of design thinking in the design of reminder aids for the elderly in an effort to create appropriate and effective solutions to the problems faced by patients at Guido Valadares Hospital Timor-Leste. This study uses a qualitative approach with descriptive analysis. The result of this study is that with a good design thinking process, this research has resulted in a solution for patients in the hospital by designing an image of a proposed reminder tool that helps patients take medication regularly. The implementation of the design thinking stage that was carried out was not optimal due to material constraints so that it did not reach the prototype and test stages for users, and the author only used three stages of design thinking (empathy, define, and ideate), without reaching the prototype and test stages does not affect the results of the identification using the design thinking method. In designing a reminder tool, it is hoped that it can help patients at the hospital to take medication on time and can check heart rate and oxygen levels in the body when needed, the product is expected to be easy to use so that users can use it easily. Reminder tools can assist users with audible alarm sounds for reminders. The reminder aid product also has a large screen so that users can see the time easily and can see the results of checking heart rate and oxygen levels and the results of subsequent alarms. The reminder aid has a button that can set the next alarm so that it helps the patient easily. Reminder aid products also have additional partitions to divide medication in the morning, noon, or evening. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).","abstrakClean":"elderly people frequently affected disease generally elderly begin experience decline physical condition resulting various physical mental change easily affected illness must take medication regular basis according proper schedule however still elderly people take medication irregularly memory starting weaken early sign experienced elderly suffer memory skill forgetting information obtained learned often difficulty completing daily work routine necessary develop research product help elderly carrying regular drugtaking activity without need help people remind research design thinking method used namely identifying want need elderly people taking medication identifying according first stage design thinking empathy interview direct observation guido valadares hospital timorleste first stage author enters second stage define describe user view basis product made first second stage already author enter third stage namely ideate describe required solution study aim describe stage design thinking design reminder aid elderly effort create appropriate effective solution problem faced patient guido valadares hospital timorleste study us qualitative approach descriptive analysis result study good design thinking process research resulted solution patient hospital designing image proposed reminder tool help patient take medication regularly implementation design thinking stage carried optimal due material constraint reach prototype test stage user author used three stage design thinking empathy define ideate without reaching prototype test stage affect result identification using design thinking method designing reminder tool hoped help patient hospital take medication time check heart rate oxygen level body needed product expected easy use user use easily reminder tool assist user audible alarm sound reminder reminder aid product also large screen user see time easily see result checking heart rate oxygen level result subsequent alarm reminder aid button set next alarm help patient easily reminder aid product also additional partition divide medication morning noon evening author","aspects":["SDG1","SDG17"]},{"Judul":"Techno-Economics Analysis of RAN-Spectrum Sharing Scheme Use Sensitivity Analysis Method","Penulis":"Wisudantyo Wahyu Priambodo, Heroe Wijanto, Nachwan Mufti Adriansyah, ","Tahun":2023,"Abstrak":"The main problem faced by cellular operators in Indonesia is the cost of infrastructure investment which is very expensiv.

A previous study established a monitoring system for air quality at Tokong Nanas (GKU) and the Deli Building of Telkom University, located in Bandung, using microsensor technology. Various forecasting techniques were also employed to predict the mass concentration of PM2.5, considering its meteorological factors. However, the study found that not all the meteorological parameters give significant results in PM2.5 forecasting, with an RMSE value of 27 \u03bcg\/m3. Hence, this study optimized the forecasting system of PM2.5 mass concentration using the Artificial Neural Network Backpropagation method. Only a few meteorological parameters were taken into consider-ation in the forecasting system, which has a significant impact on the forecast quality, such as rainfall intensity, relative humidity, and wind speed.

Image-based assessment using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging has particular promise for non-invasive full-field mapping of cerebrovascular hemodynamics. However, estimations are complicated by the narrow and tortuous intracranial vasculature, with accurate image-based quantification directly dependent on sufficient spatial resolution. Further, extended scan times are required for high-resolution acquisitions, and most clinical acquisitions are performed at comparably low resolution (>1 mm) where biases have been observed with regard to the quantification of both flow and relative pressure. The aim of our study was to develop an approach for quantitative intracranial super-resolution 4D Flow MRI, with effective resolution enhancement achieved by a dedicated deep residual network, and with accurate quantification of functional relative pressures achieved by subsequent physics-informed image processing. To achieve this, our two-step approach was trained and validated in a patient-specific in-silico cohort, showing good accuracy in estimating velocity (relative error: 15.0 \u00b1 0.1%, mean absolute error (MAE): 0.07 \u00b1 0.06 m\/s, and cosine similarity: 0.99 \u00b1 0.06 at peak velocity) and flow (relative error: 6.6 \u00b1 4.7%, root mean square error (RMSE): 0.56 mL\/s at peak flow), and with the coupled physics-informed image analysis allowing for maintained recovery of functional relative pressure throughout the circle of Willis (relative error: 11.0 \u00b1 7.3%, RMSE: 0.3 \u00b1 0.2 mmHg). Furthermore, the quantitative super-resolution approach is applied to an in-vivo volunteer cohort, effectively generating intracranial flow images at <0.5 mm resolution and showing reduced low-resolution bias in relative pressure estimation.

Mobile anchors can be an efficient solution for the number of anchors in a 3-dimensional environment requiring more local anchors. The reliability of a localization system using mobile anchors is determined by various parameters such as energy efficiency, coverage, computational complexity, and cost. Various methods have been proposed by researchers to build a reliable mobile anchor localization system. This certainly shows the many research opportunities that can be carried out in mobile anchor localization. The many opportunities in this topic will be very confusing for researchers who want to research in this field in choosing a topic area early. However, until now there is still no paper that discusses systematic mapping studies that can provide information on topic areas and trends in the field of mobile anchor localization. A systematic Mapping Study (SMS) was conducted to determine the topic area and its trends, influential authors, and produce modeling topics and trends from the resulting modeling topics. This SMS can be a solution for researchers who are interested in research in the field of mobile anchor localization in determining the research topics they are interested in for further research. This paper gives information on the mobile anchor research area, the author who has influenced mobile anchor localization research, and the topic modeling and trend that potentially promissing research in the future. The SMS includes a chronology of publications from 2017-2022, bibliometric co-occurrence, co-author analysis, topic modeling, and trends.
